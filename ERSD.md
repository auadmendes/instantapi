Get started with a video tour

To get started, watch this video about how to access Docusign account administration and manage your account:

What Is a Docusign Account?
An account is a container created for a Docusign customer (either a company or an individual) that includes their
envelopes, user memberships, templates, and other customer data. An account provides access to Docusign
services based on a subscription plan and its associated features. Each account is uniquely identified by a GUID
known as the Account ID. A customer may have one or more accounts, based on their needs.

The customer designates individuals to act as administrators of their account. Administrators can change settings
within an account, manage user memberships and access controls, and accomplish other administrative tasks.

For customers with multiple accounts, these can be collectively managed using a Docusign organization. For more
information about organizations, see the Docusign Organization Administration guide.

Major Sections of Docusign Account Administration
Docusign Account settings include several major sections:

Note: Not all the sections described below are available to all account types. The sections shown depend on the
type of Docusign plan that you have.
Account Settings - Provides information on your plan and billing, account profile, security settings, regional
settings, and branding settings.

Users and Groups Management - Provides information on managing users, groups of users, and permission profiles.

Signing and Sending - Provides information on managing the default behavior and various options for all envelopes
sent from your account.

Integrations - Provides information on managing the Connect configurations and API integration keys for your
account.

Access to Docusign Account Administration
Administrators can open Docusign account administration settings from the Docusign account and by direct access.

To access account administration settings, you must have either full account administrator or delegated
permissions.

Docusign recommends having at least two full account administrators on accounts with two or more users. For
more information, see the Multiple Docusign Account Administrators topic.

Access Account Administration Settings from Your Docusign Account
If you are an account administrator, you can use the Admin tab to navigate to your account administration settings.

Log in to your Docusign account as an administrator.
Your account opens. The top navigation bar includes the Admin tab.
Select the AdminAdmin tab in the top navigation bar.
The Overview page opens in the Accounts view. Return to your Docusign account by selecting HomeHome on the top
navigation bar.

Direct Access to Account Administration Settings
You can directly access account administration settings by going to the administrator login page and entering your
credentials at: https://apps.docusign.com/admin

To access the Demo environment, use this URL instead: https://apps-d.docusign.com/admin

You can directly access areas by using the following links:

Note: If you are not logged in, you will be prompted to enter your login information. Users with SSO must log in

Multiple Docusign Account Administrators
If you have a paid account with two or more users, each time you log in, Docusign verifies that you have more than
one active full administrator on the account. If your account has only one full administrator, an information banner
displays at the top of the page.

Having multiple full administrators maintains continuous account access if an administrator leaves the company or
is otherwise unavailable. You can review a list of users and update their assigned permission profile from the Users
page. For more information about updating user permissions, see User Management.

Docusign Account Settings Overview Page
The Overview page helps account administrators to find what they need and stay up to date. You can search for
users and account settings to quickly locate information. The Overview page also includes links to information
resources, such as Docusign University and the Support Center.

Note: Delegated administrators only see content available to them based on their permission profile. For
example, a user with the Account Settings delegated permission will not see the Find a User search box and will
only be able to access content related to account settings. For more information, see Delegated Permissions.
Account Administrator Notifications
You can view the account administrator notifications. These notifications provide just-in-time communications on
important account health information, product release notifications, and Docusign news and events.

Notifications remain in the list for 90 days, and then they are removed. You can select individual notifications to
view their details. You can filter the notifications by selecting a type, such as Account Health, Product Update, or
Training and Learning. You also can filter the notifications by selecting a date range, such as the last 24 hours, 7
days, 30 days, or 3 months.

Administrator Email Notification Subscriptions
On the account settings Overview page, you can view all of your notifications. You can also choose to receive these
notifications by email. Subscribing to notifications keeps you informed of the notifications and captures this
information for you in an email.

You can select the types of notifications to receive by email. At any time, you can change your selections or

Account Profile
The Account Profile allows you to update and maintain your account name and address of record.

In addition to the account name, your account users can set a unique company name. This is a unique value for
their Docusign user ID. The company name displays on the user's ID Card and is shown to other Docusign users,
depending on their Privacy Settings.

EXAMPLE: Company and Account Names

If you work in a small business, you'll likely use the same value for both names. For example, your company name
and account name would both be "Express Tire & Automotive".

What if you work for a large, global corporation? The account is owned by a corporate parent company, and there
are some users who work for a subsidiary. In this case, your account name might be "Hargrave International, Inc."
and the company name is that of your subsidiary, "Western Supplies, Inc."

Administrators are able to create a custom message that is displayed within the eSignature sending experience.
This message can be used to relay important announcements or other information to your users.

You can also add contact information for an administrator on the account. This information will help senders
answer account questions by putting them in touch with a selected administrator, an IT help desk, or another
internal resource that supports Docusign for your company.

Update Your Account Name and Address
The account name is a global value for every user on your Docusign account. The account name displays in
notification emails to recipients and in the account drop down menu. This value can only be changed by an account
administrator.

Security Settings
Security Settings affect authentication options for:

How your users access the account
How recipients access all envelopes sent from the account
These settings apply to all users on the account and all of the envelopes sent from the account. For settings
affecting access to envelopes, changes apply to any new envelopes created.

You must be an administrator with All Administration Capabilities to manage these settings. See Permission Profiles
for details.

Define Security Settings
As an administrator, you can control account security.

From the Accounts view, select Security SettingsSecurity Settings.
Adjust your security settings as needed. The options are described in additional topics for each section of
settings.
Select SaveSave.
Account Security
These settings add increased security to this account and the signing transactions generated by all users.

Web App Session Timeout:Web App Session Timeout: Specify a timeout duration in minutes to help ensure that an account session
does not remain open and active for an indeterminate period of time. This timeout setting includes web
browser and mobile web browser sessions. The minimum allowed value is 1 minute and the maximum is
120 minutes. The default value is 20 minutes.
Recipient Session Timeout:Recipient Session Timeout: This session timeout is for signers. Specify a timeout value in minutes for
increased security. The minimum allowed value is 1 minute and the maximum is 120 minutes. The default
value is 20 minutes.
Mobile App Session Timeout:Mobile App Session Timeout: This session timeout is for account users who use a mobile device and a
Docusign mobile app to access the account. Specify a timeout value in minutes for increased security. The
minimum allowed value is 1 minute and the maximum is 120 minutes. The default value is 20 minutes.
Suppress In Session Certificate Enforcement:Suppress In Session Certificate Enforcement: In demo accounts, you can turn off in session certificate
enforcement when developing and testing an embedded signing integration. Production accounts require
in session certificate enforcement, so you cannot change or apply this setting in production accounts.
Authentication Settings
These options set recipient authentication behavior for the account. These settings can be very important, since
your account might be charged for some authentication checks.

Recipient Authentication Settings This section determines if recipient authentication is required, can be
configured by the sender, or is disabled for the account. This setting applies to Phone Authentication, SMS
Authentication, and Knowledge-Based ID checks. There are three possible selections:

Any recipient must authenticate on every envelope sent from this account An authentication check is
required and the sender must apply one of the authentication methods to each new envelope they send.
This setting applies to Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, and Knowledge-Based ID checks.
The sender can require a recipient must authenticate on any envelope sent from this account
Authentication is configurable, allowing the sender to select one of the authentication methods as
needed. This setting applies to Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, Knowledge-Based ID, and
Access Code checks.
Disable recipient authentication for this account The sender cannot apply Phone Authentication, SMS
Authentication, or Knowledge-Based ID checks to access documents.
Recipient Authentication Triggers This section controls how often recipient authentication is required for
recipients. This setting applies to Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, Knowledge-Based ID, and Access
Code checks. The available settings are as follows:

The first time a recipient accesses an envelope per device The recipient must pass the authentication
check the first time that they access an envelope on a given device.
With this setting, recipients are not asked to authenticate again when they access the envelope from the
same browser, on the same device. If the recipient attempts to access the envelope from a different
browser or a different device, the recipient must pass authentication again. Once authenticated, that
recipient is not challenged again on the new device or browser.
When using Access Codes with this setting, the recipient is not prompted to authenticate again after the
first time, even if using a different device.
Completed envelopes are accessible without additional authentication This setting offers the
option to reduce the authentication burden for completed envelopes. When selected, it allows
authentication from signing to persist. The recipient does not need to re-authenticate when
accessing a completed envelope, regardless of the device or browser they use.
Every time a recipient accesses an envelope The recipient must pass the authentication check each time
that they try to access the envelope. However, this option can be modified by setting a time for the
Recipient Authentication Skip Option.
Recipient Authentication Skip Option. This option determines if recipients that have recently passed
authentication can skip authentication. This setting only applies to Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, and
Knowledge-Based ID checks. There are two possible settings:

Recipients cannot skip authentication when accessing subsequent envelopes from the same sender
When this option is selected, the recipient is always required to pass authentication to access envelopes.
Recipients can skip authentication when accessing subsequent envelopes from the same sender
when using the same browser, on a device, for the following duration: When this option is selected,
administrators can set the length of time that recipients are allowed to skip authentication checks when
the recipient recently passed authentication. The amount of time can be set in minutes, hours, or days.
Login Requirements: This option sets account and log in requirements for recipients. There are four possible
selections:

Not Required to Login: The recipient is not required to log on to the system. If the recipient has a
Docusign account, they can sign their document from the email link without logging on.
Login Required if Signer Has an Account: If the recipient has a Docusign account, they must log on to
their Docusign account to open the document.
Account Required – Login Once Per Session: The sender cannot send documents to anyone who does
not have a Docusign account and the recipient must log on to their Docusign account to open the
document.
Account Required – Login for Each New Document: The sender cannot send documents to anyone who
does not have a Docusign account and the recipient must log on to their Docusign account to open each
document.
General Authentication Settings
Enforce authentication requirements on sender when signing : If the sender is also a recipient on an
envelope, then any authentication requirements set on the envelope must be completed for them to view
and sign.
Hide access code in the routing order : When enabled, the access code will only be visible to the sender
and the intended recipient. All other roles in the routing order will be unable to view the access code.
Access Codes
Use these options to enable and set requirements for the format of access codes used for an additional measure of
recipient security, and to enable the automatic Access Code Generator.

Enforce access code rules: When selected, the access code rules can be entered and are enforced when a
sender adds an access code requirement during sending. The access code rules are only enabled when this
option is selected. The access code rules are:
- Minimum access code length: This sets the minimum length for an access code. It can be 6–50
characters.
- Access codes must include at least: This sets the characters required (letter, number, and special
character) for an access code. One or more options can be selected. A special character is any
keyboard character that is not a letter, number, or space. The following characters are not allowed: <
and > and the character combination "&#". The & or # characters can be used separately.
Enable Access Code Generator: When selected, senders can use the Access Code Generator to
automatically generate and copy access codes.
Password Security
The Docusign system allows users a set number of login attempts with an incorrect password. For account security,
if a user enters the wrong password too many times, the system locks the user out temporarily. Users can attempt
to log in again after a brief waiting period.

Note: When administrators update password rules, the new rules apply when users either create a new
password or update an existing password. Until either scenario exists, users can log in with their existing
passwords created according to the previous rules.
The Password Rules option allows administrators to set the following rules for passwords used by account users to
access Docusign.

Basic – The minimum password length is 6 characters with no other password requirements.
Medium – The minimum password length is 7 characters and must have one uppercase letter, one
lowercase letter, and one number or special character.
Strong – The minimum password length is 9 characters and must have one uppercase letter, one
lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.
Custom – You can customize the length and age of passwords. The age is the minimum number of days
after a password is set before it can be changed. You can specify whether uppercase, lowercase, numbers,
and special characters must be included in the password.
Note: Angle brackets ("<" ">") and spaces are never allowed in passwords.
Note: Docusign removed the Password QuestionsPassword Questions option and recommends using a secondary phone number or
email for account recovery instead. Existing customers currently using security questions and answers (SQSA)
are prompted to make this change before the end of support in January 2025.
Set Password Rules
Updated password requirements take effect when users create a new password or update an existing password.
Users who are doing neither can still log in with an existing password created with the previous requirements.

From the Accounts view, select Security SettingsSecurity Settings.
Scroll down to the Password Security section, and select Show Password RulesShow Password Rules.
The Password Rules page opens.
Select the password strength for the account.
(Optional) If you select Custom for the password strength, select the password requirements for the length
and age of passwords.
(Optional) To require that passwords expire, select Enable password expiration and enter the number of
days until new passwords expire.
Select Save.
The password rules for your account are saved.

User Personal Information
This option controls the changes account members can make to their personal account information in their My
Preferences view.

Allow users to edit their name. When selected, account members can edit their name in their My
Preferences, Personal Information section. If you need to control user names in your Docusign account,
clear this option to restrict users from making any changes, as described in the user topic Change Your
Name.
Email Security
This option enables Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption for all outgoing emails from the account.

Enforce minimal TLS requirements for outbound emails.Enforce minimal TLS requirements for outbound emails. When selected, the Docusign mail server will
attempt to encrypt connections with the latest version of the TLS protocol, TLS 1.3, and will go down to
TLS 1.2, which is the minimum version required to establish the connection. Any recipient's server that
doesn't support TLS 1.3 or 1.2 won't receive outbound emails from that account, and the sender will be
notified about the undelivered email when the email delivery fails.
Accounts enabled with Custom Email Domain have TLS enforcement by default. In this case, the setting is
enabled and locked from making changes. This feature is available for Enterprise and Business Pro
eSignature plans.
Account Discovery
If Account Discovery is enabled for an eSignature account, new users signing up for a free or trial account can
choose from a list of paid accounts from the same domain name as their account email address. This helps new
users join the same account as their team or department. When the new users log in, they will view an Account
Discovery screen similar to this example screen.

The new user can select an account and request to be added to that paid account. The Account Discovery screen
appears once during the Free and Trial users’ onboarding flow.

The account administrators will receive an email notifying them that a user has requested to join the account.
Administrators receive only one email a day containing all requests from that day. Administrators can choose to add
new users to the correct accounts or ignore the requests.

The Account Discovery feature is turned on by default for qualifying accounts. Qualifying accounts meet all of the
following criteria:

Accounts are not listed as government or public sector accounts.
Account plan type allows more than one seat or user.
Account administrators have a company email address domain. Personal email address domains are not
allowed.
Accounts do not have SSO enabled and do not have "Prevent unmanaged signups" selected.
Administrators can choose to turn off the Account Discovery feature.

Turn Off Account Discovery
As the account administrator, you can turn off account discovery in Security Settings by disallowing your eSignature
account to be searchable. When the setting is turned off, no Free or Trial users in a company’s domain can view the
Account Discovery screen, and administrators will not receive any account discovery email requests to join specific
accounts from users.

Note: If you are an account administrator for multiple Docusign accounts, make sure that you switch to the
appropriate account before changing any security settings.
From the Accounts view, select Security SettingsSecurity Settings.
Scroll down to the Account Discovery section at the end of the page.
Uncheck Make my account searchableMake my account searchable.
Your eSignature account is not searchable for account discovery.

more information, see Permission Profiles.
As an administrator, you can specify the time zone, date and time format, default language, and signed date
behavior for account users. The settings are located on the Regional Settings page.

Time Zone: The time zone, date, and time format settings are used to record the date and time of events
listed in the Envelope History and the Certificate of Completion.
Note: Changes to these settings affect Envelope History. Events listed in Envelope History reflect the
new values. The audit events in the Certificate of Completion remain unchanged and reflect the
settings that were in place when the event occurred.
By default, these settings apply to all users on the account. If you allow users to set their own time zone
and date format, users can adjust the settings in the My PreferencesMy Preferences menu, under Regional SettingsRegional Settings.

Branding offers a way to customize the Docusign experience for both senders and recipients. With the branding
controls in Docusign, as an account administrator you can reinforce your brand presence and reassure signers that
documents sent to them through your Docusign account are coming from your organization. The branding
configurations you specify are global and apply to all users on your account and every recipient experience for
every envelope sent from your account.

You must be an eSignature administrator with All Administration Capabilities in order to manage these settings. See
Permission Profiles for details.

All branding changes are captured in the account audit log.

Note: Some advanced features and options are supported only in certain Docusign plans. Your account plan
might not support some options discussed in this topic. For more information about which options are
available for your account, check your account plan or contact Docusign Support.
What can you configure for signing and sending brands?
Signing brands offer control over the styling of the email notifications sent to recipients and the signing view. You
can add a custom logo and specify a color theme to add your company branding to these interactions. You can set a
default signing brand for all envelopes sent from your account. Senders can select a brand to apply to the
envelopes they send. Signing brands are also applied and saved with templates.

If your account includes PowerForms, the forms inherit the signing brand used on the associated template.

Advanced configuration options are available to customize destination URLs, links, and resource files. These
options are covered in Advanced Configuration for Signing Brands.

The sending brand provides control over your Docusign account styling. You can specify a single sending brand for
all account members, and add a custom logo and specify a color theme to apply your company branding. You can
also specify a brand for signing request emails sent by Docusign to your signers.

As an optional part of a signing brand, you can specify the web page displayed after certain recipient actions, such
as when they complete signing or decline to sign. If your organization embeds the signing experience into another
site, or uses PowerForms, this can be a useful feature to keep your signers on your site, rather than have them
navigate away to pages on the Docusign domain. For more information about how destination URLs are used with
PowerForms, see Branding Considerations.

In addition to controlling the navigation, you can opt to include contextually relevant parameters to your landing
page. You can pass the envelope ID, the recipient's name or email address, and any envelope custom fields defined
for your account.

Resource Files
Note: These features are temporarily disabled for account plans purchased on the web after November 20,
For more information, contact Docusign Support.
Resource files are an optional method to control the text elements in your account signing view and for emails sent
by your account. If the resource file option is not enabled for an account, contact Docusign Support for more
information and assistance.

Important: Customizing resource files is an advanced branding configuration option which can significantly
impact your account, and should be done only by someone with expertise in XML and HTML. The resource files
are subject to change without notice. If you customize your resource files, after each release, Docusign
recommends you review any changes and update your custom files as needed.
Docusign eSignature uses two resource files: one for signing and one for email messages. In addition to setting text
elements, the signing resource file also controls some of the dialog boxes displayed in the signing view.

To use resource files, you will download the appropriate resource file for the information you want to change,
modify the resource file, and then upload your modified file to the Docusign system. When you upload a modified
resource file, only the differences between your modified file and the original file are saved by the system. An
account can only upload one of each type of custom resource file for each signing brand, so all changes for all
languages must be included in the uploaded files.

You can modify and upload one or both (signing and email) of the resource files to customize them for your
account. If you do not upload a modified resource file, the system will use the default information in the original
resource file.

For more information about specific resource files, see the following guides:

Signing Resource File

Stamps
Docusign stamps allows the administrator to assign users or groups to a stamp as a way of giving signing authority
on behalf of others. A stamp may represent an organization, a part of an organization, such as a department, or the
identity of another user. In certain countries such as Japan, stamps are used in place of signatures. Docusign
stamps provide a higher level of control for sensitive stamps like company or departmental eHanko.

Historically, whoever has access to physical stamps can approve official documents. Account administrators can
useDocusign stamps to create a set of stamps for the organization and manage access to use those stamps.

Note: Stamps are only supported on Business Pro and Enterprise Pro plans.
What the Signer Sees When Using Stamps
Opening the envelope

When a recipient opens an envelope that contains a stamp, they see the stamp field in the location where it was
placed.

Clicking on the stamp

Clicking on the stamp field displays a dialog box where the recipient can either choose an existing stamp or assign a
new one.

Selecting a stamp

The recipient can select a stamp and select DONEDONE to apply that stamp to the document.

The stamp is applied to the document.

Stamp options

The recipient can modify the stamp before completing the envelope through several options.

Rotate - Rotate the stamp.
Custom Date - Change the date on the stamp (only for Name + Date format stamps). The date must be in
'YY.MM.DD format.
Create New - Replace the stamp with a new one.
Choose From Existing - Replace the stamp with an existing stamp.
Remove - Remove the selected stamp.
If the recipient selects either the Create New or Add New option in the Existing Stamps dialog box, a new dialog
box displays to generate a new stamp.

eSignature Value Calculator
The Docusign eSignature Value Calculator estimates the current and potential value of your Docusign
implementation. Docusign regularly partners with customers of all sizes across multiple industries and use cases to
gather usage data and develop benchmarks. This benchmark data represents aggregated values for a selected
industry and use case. You can modify the estimate by selecting an estimation approach to best match your
company's current or future use of Docusign.

The Value Calculator displays in the Account section in your Docusign account settings. Contact Docusign Support if
you do not see the Value Calculator option.

Note: All estimates are based on aggregated customer data. They do not indicate or guarantee past or future
benefits. All currency data is provided in United States Dollars (USD).
Docusign provides three types of benchmark data:

Hard Cost Savings per DocumentHard Cost Savings per Document: Each document sent with Docusign reduces the operational costs of
printing, distributing, and storing hard copies. This is an estimate of the operational costs eliminated when
using Docusign.
Productivity Improvements per DocumentProductivity Improvements per Document: Docusign increases efficiency in a variety of areas. This
efficiency translates to improved productivity for your company. This is the estimated time saved by
expediting the creation, processing, and storage of documents. The dollar value displayed represents the
average value at that time.
Revenue Gains per DocumentRevenue Gains per Document: When using Docusign in a customer facing role, the reduction of time to
completion and the increase in close rates translates to increased revenue. This value represents the
potential revenue gained by using Docusign with your Customers.
Note: Revenue gains per document are only available for customer-facing, revenue generating use
cases.
Once you've selected your industry and use case, Docusign can estimate your value per envelope. This estimate is a
combination of the benchmark data that shows the average value of each document sent with Docusign.

You can adjust the number of documents sent per month to estimate the value Docusign can bring to your
company.

Users and Groups Management
As an account administrator, you can manage individual users, groups of users, and permission profiles in the Users Users
and Groupsand Groups section.

Note: Docusign CLM enabled accounts manage users and groups for the account through your Docusign
organization settings. Contact your Docusign organization administrator to manage users and groups at the
organization level. For more information, see Managing Groups and Managing Users.
License Management in Account Administration
For accounts on IAM plans, account administrators can view user license counts and assign licenses to users in a
new License section on the Users page. Administrators can track license assignments without assistance from
Docusign Support or account team. Administrators can view license counts in a new License section on the Users
page in the Accounts view.

Note: License management rolls out to customers on IAM plans starting March 20, 2025, and completing by May
30, 2025. License management will be implemented for all customers on IAM plans. All users on existing IAM
accounts will be assigned Full licenses.
The following license types are available based on the IAM plan purchased:

License Type Plan variants Paid or Free
Full
Full - Enterprise license
Paid
License Type Plan variants Paid or Free
Full - Professional license
Full - Standard license
Full - Sales license
Full - CX license
Unmanaged Participant N/A Free
The following functionality is included for each license type:

Full:Full: Prepare and send agreements, access Navigator, and create Maestro workflows. Full license holders
can access all paid features with the exception of administrator-specific functionality.
Unmanaged Participant:Unmanaged Participant: View their own completed agreements in Navigator and sign agreements.
Each user can only be assigned one license per subscription.

Use Bulk Uploads to Update License Assignments for Users
For accounts on IAM plans, account administrators can adjust license assignments to meet expected license usage.
An account administrator can follow these steps to change license assignments.

Downgrading user licenses to Unmanaged Participant removes access to functionality not supported by the license.
Administrators are responsible for communicating these changes to their users and managing the license
assignments for their organizational needs.

To assign a license for an individual user, you can edit the user and change the license type.

Note: Every IAM user must have a license assigned to them. Licenses cannot be removed from users who are on
an IAM plan. To remove a paid license from a user, you can edit the user and change the license type to
Unmanaged Participant.
Note: Additional functionality beyond signing will be increasingly restricted for Unmanaged Participant licenses
in the future. Users may experience changes without prior notice.
From the Accounts view, select UsersUsers.
Select Download UsersDownload Users to export a CSV of all users in your account.
Update the LicenseType column to reflect the correct license type for the user. Examples are Unmanaged
Participant or a Full license, such as Full - Enterprise.
See the list of license types associated with your purchased plan.
Bulk import the updated CSV file to the account.
User Management
Note: Docusign CLM enabled accounts add, update, and close users for the account through your Docusign
organization settings. Contact your Docusign organization administrator to manage users at the organization
level. For more information, see the User Management topic in Docusign Organization Administration.
As a Docusign account administrator, the Users page lets you manage the users on your account. You can add users
on your account in accordance with your plan details. You can view how many active users you have on the Plan
and Billing page. Users must activate their account, at which point they become billable users on the account.

For users in the Docusign system, an email address can belong to only one active or pending user. When you add
users, the system checks if the address is already in use before creating the new user. If there are one or more
closed users only (no active or pending users), you have the option of reactivating one of the closed users or adding
a new user to your account. You can view closed users by using the filter menu on the Users page.

If your company recycles email addresses and reuses them for different employees, when you run into the
reactivate or add new user option, you should choose to add a new user. This ensures that the new employee does
not get access to any envelopes that belonged to the former account member.

Note: If you are an administrator with delegated administration rights for Users and Groups only, you can
perform the actions described in this guide for non-administrative users only. You cannot manage any user with
a permission profile that includes any level of administrative rights.
User Invitation and Activation Process
Adding a user to an account requires actions from an administrator and the new user. As an administrator, you can
add a user and sending an invitation to their email address. To complete the process, the user must complete the
activation process.

Optionally, you can include an access code as part of the activation process. The activation process also has an
option for the user to decline the invitation.

The user invitation and activation process includes the following steps:

Log into your Docusign account and open the UsersUsers page.
Creates a user by adding their email address, public information, and optional access code. An invitation is
sent to the email address of the new user.
The user receives an activation email and selects the ActivateActivate button.
The Create Account or Decline Invitation page opens.

If the user selects Create AccountCreate Account and the administrator has required an access code, the user views the
Access Code page. If an access code is not required, the user is redirected to the Create Your Password
page. If the user declines the invitation, the invite is invalidated and a message page informs the user that
the invitation is no longer valid.
If the user enters the access code correctly, they are redirected to the Create Your Password page. If the
user does not enter the access code correctly, the invitation is invalidated. If you want to re-invite the user,
you can resend an invitation on the Users page.
After the user sets a password, they have been activated and are added to the account. The user is logged
in to the account and views the Docusign account Home page.
Search for Users
As an account administrator, you can search for users by name or by email address from the Users page. You can
use filters to refine your search and limit it to users by permission profile, user group, or status, such as active,
pending, and closed.

From the Accounts view, select UsersUsers.
Enter a name in the SearchSearch box or, if you want to search for an email address, select EmailEmail from the
dropdown and enter an email address in the SearchSearch box.
(Optional) Select FilterFilter to restrict your search to users by permission profile, group, and status. Select the
filter combination that you want to use, and select ApplyApply.
You can combine the filters to narrow your results but you must have one option selected for StatusStatus. By
default, ActiveActive and PendingPending are selected.
Select SearchSearch.
The users that meet the search criteria you entered are displayed.

Add Users to Accounts
As an administrator, you can add users to accounts and reactivate closed users.

Note: For accounts on IAM plans, the Users page includes an additional column titled License that shows the
license type assigned to the user. This is only for customers on IAM plans. Other customers on eSignature plans
do not have this column and do not have licenses.
From the Accounts view, select UsersUsers.
Select Add UserAdd User.
Enter the email address for the new user, and select NextNext.
If the email address is already part of your account:
Active or Pending user:Active or Pending user: If the email address belongs to a user whose status is either an active or
pending, the Existing User dialog box displays. You can select View ProfileView Profile and review and edit the
user.
Closed user:Closed user: If the email address belongs to one or more closed users only, you have the option to
reactivate a closed user or add a new user. If you reactivate a closed membership, the user gains
access to all associated envelopes. If you are recycling an email address to add a new user to your
account, select Add New UserAdd New User.
Enter the profile information for the user, such as user name and default language, and select NextNext.
After activation, the user can change these fields by using the My PreferencesMy Preferences option.
(Optional) Enter an access code, and select NextNext. If you add a code, you must provide the code to the user
for them to activate their account.
In the permission profile and groups step:
a. Select a permission profile to assign to the new user. See the Permission Profiles topic for more
information.
b. Select a license type to assign to the new user. If your account is on an IAM plan, you must assign a
license or select the Unmanaged Participant license.
c. (Optional) Select AssignAssign GroupsGroups to select groups to assign to the new user.
Select Add UserAdd User.
The user is added to the account with a status of PendingPending.
The user you added receives an activation email. After the user completes the steps in the activation email, the

membership status changes to ActiveActive.

Resend Activation Emails to Pending New Users
As an administrator, you can resend activation emails to users with a status of PendingPending.

From the Accounts view, select UsersUsers.
Use the filter to locate users with a status of PendingPending.
Select ActionsActions > Resend InvitationResend Invitation.
(Optional) For additional security, enter an access code. Provide the code to the user, as it is required for
account activation.
The user receives an email with activation instructions for the account.

View or Edit a User
User details include contact information, permission profile, groups, and the API Username. View or edit users with
the Active status. Users with the Closed or Pending status are view-only.

Note: The API Username is used in the OAuth JSON Web Token grant flow and other API methods. For more
information about the OAuth JWT grant flow, visit the Docusign Developer Center.
Note: For accounts on IAM plans, when a user is closed, the user license is not automatically downgraded from
a Full license to Unmanaged Participant. When you close a user, you must downgrade the user license first
before closing the user.
From the Accounts view, select UsersUsers.
Locate the user that you want to view or edit.
Note: Only users with the Active status are available to edit.
In the ActionAction menu for the selected user, select ViewView or EditEdit.
Review the user details and update the entries as needed.
Remove Users from Accounts
To remove users from accounts, you must close them. Closed users cannot send new envelopes or access their
account. As an administrator, you can also remove users from signing groups they belong to.

Note: Closed users will lose access to any completed documents in their account. However, recipients can still
complete envelopes that were sent by users before they were closed. Before closing a user, it is recommended
to transfer the ownership of the envelopes or ask the user to download all of their completed documents. After
removing a user, you can find templates where a removed user is a recipient or signer.
Note: For accounts on IAM plans, when a user is closed, the user license is not automatically downgraded from
a Full license to Unmanaged Participant. When you close a user, you must downgrade the user license first
before closing the user.
From the Accounts view, select UsersUsers.
Locate the user whose account you want to close.
Select CloseClose from the ActionsActions dropdown menu for the selected user.
(Optional) If you also want to remove the user from any signing groups the user belongs to, in the Close

Reactivate Users
As an administrator, you can reactivate closed users. If you are an administrator with delegated administration
rights for Users and Groups only, you can close or reactivate only non-administrative users. You cannot manage
users with permission profiles that include any level of administrative rights.

Note: An email address can belong to only one active or pending user. When you attempt to reactivate a user,
the system checks to see if the email address is in use. If it is active, you cannot reactivate the user unless you
close the user with the active email address.
From the Accounts view, select UsersUsers.
Locate the closed user whose account you want to reactivate. To search for closed users, select FilterFilter >
ClosedClosed. Clear the ActiveActive and PendingPending check boxes, and select ApplyApply.
Select ActionsActions > ReactivateReactivate for the closed user that you want to reactivate.

Reset User Passwords
You can initiate a password reset for users on your account. You can reset a user password if a user forgets it or if
you want users to create a new password for security reasons. When you initiate a password reset, users receive a
link and instructions for changing the password.

From the Accounts view, select UsersUsers.
Locate the user whose password needs to be reset.
Select ActionsActions > Reset PasswordReset Password.
The user receives an email with a link and instructions for changing the password.

User Bulk Actions
As an administrator, you can add or update multiple users simultaneously through the Bulk AddBulk Add and Bulk Update Bulk Update
options. To perform bulk actions, you upload a comma-separated value (CSV) file that contains the user
information.

The following considerations apply to bulk actions:

You can perform only one type of bulk action in each CSV file upload. Therefore, you must use separate
bulk actions to add and update users. If your CSV file contains both new and existing users, existing users
are skipped and not updated.
A CSV file upload is limited to 2,000 users. To add or update more than 2,000 users, divide them between
CSV files.
When working with CSV files for bulk actions, only UTF-8 encoding is supported.
All Docusign account administrators, including delegated administrators, can use bulk actions to add or
update users. If you are an account administrator with delegated administration rights for users and
groups only, you can perform bulk actions only for non-administrative users. For example, you cannot add
a new user with a permission profile that includes any level of account administrative rights, and you
cannot assign administrative rights to a user.
Note: In account settings, you can add groups to a user through the bulk actions option, but you
cannot remove groups from a user through the bulk actions option.
Only users with an active or pending account membership can be updated through bulk actions.
Account administrators cannot use bulk actions to change user email addresses for existing Docusign
memberships. To update a user email address, ask the user to follow the steps in Change Your Email
Address.
A Docusign administrator can use bulk actions to update user email addresses for domain users. For more
information, see Bulk Update Users.
Add Multiple Users through Bulk Actions
Before you begin

To use a bulk action to add multiple users to an account at one time, you must have a comma-separated value (CSV)
file with the user information properly formatted. You can create a CSV file according to the information described
in CSV File Format for User Additions, or you can download a sample CSV file and add the user information to it. See
Download a Sample CSV File.
As an administrator, you can add multiple users to an account simultaneously through the Add UsersAdd Users bulk action.

From the Accounts view, select UsersUsers.
Select Bulk AddBulk Add.
Select Upload FileUpload File in the Add Users dialog box.
Select SubmitSubmit and confirm that you want to process the file.
Note: An account can only have one in-process CSV file at a time.
The system processes the file and checks for errors in the format and user information. The system sends
an activation email to the newly added users.
Select the icon in the ActionsActions column to update the job status.
Download a Sample CSV File for the Add Users Bulk Action
To save time preparing the comma-separated value (CSV) file needed to upload users in bulk, you can download a
sample file. The sample CSV file is pre-formatted for the bulk add operation and ready to be populated with your
new user information.

From the Accounts view, select UsersUsers.
Select Bulk AddBulk Add.
Select Download TemplateDownload Template in the Add Users dialog box.
The sample file is downloaded and available for you to populate with your new user information.

CSV File Format for User Additions
As an administrator, you can add multiple users to your account in a bulk action by uploading a CSV file that
contains the user information. To save time, you can download a sample CSV file from the bulk actions in your
Docusign account. It has the required format so that you can populate it with the user information.

The CSV upload file is made up of a header row with the column headers and a row of user data for each user that
you want to add to your account.

Adding and updating users must be done in separate bulk actions. Your CSV can contain both new and existing
users, but when you do a bulk add users, any existing users will be skipped and not updated. You must run a
separate bulk update users action to update existing users.

Note: The maximum number of users in a CSV is 2,000. To add more users, split them into multiple CSV files.
The header row for add users

The first line of the file is the header row for the file and defines each of the columns. The header values are not
required to be in the order listed and are not case-sensitive, but the text must match listed values.

*Required columns: Your Add Users CSV file must contain these columns: FirstName, LastName, UserEmail, and
eSignPermissionProfile. The rest of the header values are optional. Do not add additional columns to the CSV, as
this will cause the import to fail.

The acceptable column header values for an Add Users CSV file are:

Header Row Value Description
FirstName The user's first name. Required column.
LastName The user's last name. Required column.
UserEmail The user's complete email address. Required column.
eSignPermissionProfile The user's permission profile on the Docusign account.
The value must match an existing permission profile on
the account. This value is not case-sensitive. For
example, for the default permission profile "DS Sender",
you could enter "ds sender", "DS SENDER", or "DS
Sender". Required column.
JobTitle The user's job title.
CompanyName The user's company name.
Header Row Value Description
Group
The user's assigned groups. The Group values must
match existing Group names for the account. To add
users to more than one group, you can add Group
columns to the file.
Notes:
You can add groups to a user, but you cannot
remove groups from a user through the bulk
actions option.
You do not need to add users to the Everyone
group, because all new users are automatically
added to that group.
AddressLine1 The user's address - first line.
AddressLine2 The user's address - second line.
City The user's city name.
StateRegionProvince The user's regional location.
PostalCode The user's postal code.

The access code option (adding an access code for authentication during user activation) cannot be used with this
bulk action.

The user data

In the lines of the file below the header row, add the user information with commas used as the delimiter
(separator) between each value.

If you are using Microsoft® Excel® to create your file, you can enter the header values (UserName, UserEmail, and so
on) in different columns on the first line, enter the user information on subsequent lines, and save the file as a CSV
file. You do not need to add commas. Excel will automatically do this when you save the file.

Example Excel file

Update Multiple Users through a Bulk Action
To update information for multiple users simultaneously, upload a comma-separated value (CSV) file that contains
the updates to the user account information.

Tip: To save time preparing the upload file, download a CSV file of existing users in your account. Update the
user information in the CSV file as necessary and upload the modified file. See User Lists and Permission
Profiles Downloads.
Create a CSV file with the user information as described in CSV File Format for User Updates.
From the Accounts view, select UsersUsers.

Select the refresh icon in the ActionsActions column in the Bulk Actions log to update the job status.
CSV File Format for User Updates
The comma-separated value (CSV) file requires a specific format for the user updates to be successfully uploaded
and applied.

Header row and required columns

The first line of the file is the header row, which defines the columns. The header row is followed by rows of user
data. Each row corresponds to a user.

Two columns are required in the CSV file: UserEmailUserEmail and APIUserNameAPIUserName. Other columns are optional.

The following table contains the acceptable column header values. The header values are not required to be in the
order listed in the table and are not case-sensitive. However, for the upload to be successful, the header value text
in the CSV file must match the value text.

The CSV file cannot contain columns with header values other than those listed. If extra columns are present, the
updates cannot be made.

Acceptable column header values for the user updates CSV file

Header Row Value* Description

Bulk Actions Log
This Bulk Actions log page shows a list of bulk actions, such as uploading multiple users and envelope transfers for
your account, and the progress of the actions. You can leave this page while the processing is in progress. If you
choose to remain on the page, you must refresh the job display to see an updated status. Select the refresh icon in
the Actions column to update the job status.

When processing is complete, the StatusStatus column shows the general results of the bulk action:

To review a summary of the bulk action results, select the menu in the Actions column and select DetailsDetails.

The details dialog box provides information on how many users were successfully added and a summary of any
errors.

For users that were not successfully added or updated, the message provides a short description of the problem
and allows you to download the CSV file to correct the issues. The downloaded file includes a "ProcessingResults"
column that specifies the issue for any row that failed to process correctly. After correcting the issues, the file can be
uploaded and resubmitted for processing.

If there is a problem with the CSV file, processing might fail. If this occurs, download the file, then review and correct
the contents. Alternately, you can create and upload a new CSV file.

Manage Shared Access to Envelopes
Shared access offers users the ability to send and manage envelopes on behalf of another user on the account.
Administrators can select the Manage Shared AccessManage Shared Access option to manage which users have access to the envelopes of
a specific user.

While the existing shared envelopes options allows managing envelopes on behalf of other users, shared access
also allows users to share draft envelopes, move the shared envelopes, create custom folders, and view which users
have access to the envelopes.

Note: The options on the Actions menu for Share envelope with a user and Share user’s envelopes are now on
the Manage Shared Access page. Shared envelopes is now in maintenance mode and will no longer be updated.
Contact your account representative for more information.
For auditing which users have access to other users' envelopes, you can monitor events in the Audit Logs page. The
Audit Logs page shows a log entry for every time the shared access settings are changed in an account. For
information about shared access events in audit logs, see Shared Access Events in Audit Logs. For more information
about audit logs, see Audit Logs.

Limitations and other considerations

Sharing with groups: Shared access can be granted by administrators from one user to another, but not
from a user to a group.
Sharing with users outside of account: Shared access can only be granted to users on the same account,
similar to shared envelopes and delegated signing.
Learn about the changes to the sending and envelope management experience in Shared Access to
Envelopes.
If you need to share access to envelopes of a closed user, you can transfer the envelopes to yourself or to
another active user and then access the envelopes. For more information, see Transfer Envelopes and
Templates Between Users.
Share Access with Other Users
As an administrator, you can allow users of an account to share access to envelopes with other users on the
account.

From the Accounts view, select UsersUsers.
Locate the user that you want to manage sharing settings for, and select ActionsActions > Manage Shared AccessManage Shared Access.
Select Share Access with OthersShare Access with Others.
Select one of the following permissions, and select NextNext:
Allow to manage on behalf of [User Name]Allow to manage on behalf of [User Name]: Allows the selected user to view envelopes, view history,
download files, and move envelopes into folders.
Allow to edit on behalf of [User Name]Allow to edit on behalf of [User Name]: In addition to the manage permissions, allows the selected
user to correct, resend, and void the user's envelopes.
Allow to send on behalf of [User Name]Allow to send on behalf of [User Name]: In addition to the manage and edit permissions, allows the
selected user to send envelopes, edit drafts, resend, void, and correct in addition to managing on
the user's behalf.
Note: Depending on your account plan, you might not have access to all permissions.
Users that do not have sending permissions can only be granted access to manage another user’s
envelopes. Inactive users or users pending activation cannot be granted access and cannot have their
envelopes accessed by other users.
The send permission allows others to send and manage envelopes on behalf of the user, whereas the
manage permission allows others to manage envelopes on behalf of the user but not send.
Select the start and finish dates to control the duration of the shared access.
The start date can be the current date or any future date. An end date is optional and can be any date
equal to or after the start date. If an end date is specified, the access will expire on that date without any
manual action needed. If you do not specify an end date, the access continues until someone manually
removes it.
Select NextNext.
Select the users for the shared access permission.
To locate users more easily, use the SearchSearch option. You can select up to 100 users to share access to a
user's envelopes.
If users are not available for selection, those users have shared access. To update their permission, remove
their current access.
You can view which users have shared envelopes access to this user. This is helpful if you want to create
similar access using the shared access feature.
Select SaveSave.
The users you selected have shared access to the envelopes of the current user.

View or Remove Shared Access with a User
As an administrator, you can view and manage the shared access with a specific user. The Shared with [User Name]
page shows the list of users that the current user shares access to their envelopes.

From the Accounts view, select UsersUsers.
Locate the user that you want to manage sharing settings for, and select ActionsActions > Manage Shared AccessManage Shared Access.
Select Shared with [User Name]Shared with [User Name].
The users that shared access to their envelopes with this user are listed.
(Optional) Select ViewView next a user name that has the shared access for this user.
In the list for the shared access for the user you selected, select RemoveRemove to remove the shared access to
their envelopes for the user you are managing.
Select RemoveRemove on the confirmation message.
The shared access is removed for the user.
Shared Access Events in Audit Logs
As an administrator, you can view the changes made in your account. The Audit Logs page shows a log entry for
every time the shared access settings are changed in an account. On the Audit Log page, you can also filter the
events, and you can export the data to a .csv file.

The audit logs fields use the following terminology for shared access events:

AccountId:AccountId: The account of the principal user.
AgentUser:AgentUser: The user who is taking the action on behalf of another user or is accessing another user’s
envelopes.
Permission:Permission: The permission assigned, which is either Send or Manage.
PrincipalUser:PrincipalUser: The user whom the action was taken on behalf of or whose envelopes are being accessed.
UserAuthorizationId:UserAuthorizationId: The ID of the authorization event of access granted for an agent to the envelopes of a
principal user.
Envelope Sharing Between Account Users
Envelope sharing permits users on the same account to see and take action on shared envelopes.

The ability to share envelopes between your account users is helpful for scenarios such as coverage during a leave
of absence, delegated management of Docusign transactions, or other collaborative workflows. As a Docusign
administrator, you can set up envelope sharing and allow users to see and act on envelopes that belong to another
Docusign user.

Sharing is enabled on an individual user basis. When a user's envelopes are shared, the users who were granted
access can see and act on all of that user's envelopes.

Note: Shared envelopes is now in maintenance mode and will no longer be updated. While you can continue to
use shared envelopes, shared access also allows users to share draft envelopes, move the shared envelopes,
create custom folders, and view which users have access to the envelopes. For more information, see Manage
Shared Access to Envelopes.
See Shared Envelopes for more information about how users see and act on envelopes shared with them.

Note: All changes made to sharing settings are recorded in the audit log.
Manage Envelope Sharing Among Users
As an administrator, you can allow users of an account to share envelopes with other users on the account.
Specifically, you can allow a selected user to access the envelopes of other users, or you can allow other users to
access the selected user's envelopes.

Note: The options on the Actions menu for Share envelope with a userShare envelope with a user and Share user’s envelopesShare user’s envelopes are now on
the Manage Shared Access page. Shared Envelopes is now in maintenance mode and will no longer be updated.

time. To select all users that are listed in the search results (up to 100), use the select all option at the
top of the list.
Select AssignAssign.
The users you selected are displayed.

Permission Profiles
A permission profile is a group of settings that determines the behavior and actions available for a user.
Administrators assign a permission profile to a user when the user is added to an account.

Permission profiles make it easier to manage permission settings for a large number of users. Administrators can
modify the profile settings, which are applied to all users with that profile, instead of changing permission settings
for each user individually.

Docusign eSignature account administration includes three default permission profiles:

DS Admin: can access all eSignature features and can manage all account settings and users for an
account.
DS Sender: can access to basic eSignature features. No administrator access. DS Senders can only send
envelopes and use templates and PowerForms. They cannot use bulk send, create templates, or manage
envelopes through the API.
DS Viewer: can view and sign envelopes in eSignature. No access to sending envelopes.
Although you cannot modify or delete the default permission profiles, you can copy them to use as templates for
other permission profiles.

Note: If your account includes the Advanced Administration module, you can use the delegated administration
options to create permission profiles that have limited administrator capabilities.

Delegated Permissions
As a Docusign account administrator, the Permission Profiles page lets you manage the user permission profiles for
your account. The Delegated Administration functionality allows administrators to create Permission Profiles that
have limited administrator capabilities in addition to the standard user permissions.

Note: For a more in-depth discussion of use cases, review the Best Practices for eSignature Delegated
Administration white paper.
Note: If your account does not have Delegated Administration enabled, the Permission Profiles dialog box only
shows User Permissions. Refer to Permission Profiles for more information on User Permissions.
Delegated Administration is available only for certain plans. If you do not see the functionality described in this
guide, contact Docusign Support to determine if it can be enabled for your account.

Administrator Permissions
These determine the administrative actions available for all account users assigned to the permission profile.

By selecting Allow SomeAllow Some, you can further tailor a permission profile to meet the needs of your users. Provide users
with the level of access required for their roles while limiting access to other administrative tools.

Allow All:Allow All: When selected, users with this permission have access to the Administration view for the account
and can manage account settings, users and groups, signing and sending settings, the document retention
policy, and integrations. The default permission profile DS Admin uses this option. Default permission
profiles cannot be modified.
Allow Some:Allow Some: These alternative administrator options grant limited administrative rights. Delegated
administrators are restricted to the categories selected and limit a user’s access to certain administrator
functions. The options are as follows:
- Users and Groups:Users and Groups: When selected, also need to select the level of access to grant users with this
permission. At least the View OnlyView Only level of access is required to enable Shared AccessShared Access or Envelope Envelope
TransferTransfer.
- Users with View OnlyView Only access can view all users, administrators, and groups in the account.
They won't be able to make any changes to these users or groups.
- Users with Edit Groups OnlyEdit Groups Only access can view all users, administrators, and groups in the
account. They can manage groups but not users. They can add, rename, and delete groups,
add users to a group, and remove users from a group.
- Users with Edit Users and GroupsEdit Users and Groups access can view all users, administrators, and groups in the
account. They can add, edit, or close non-administrator users. They can perform bulk user
actions to add or update non-administrator users, and can download users. They can also add,
rename, and delete groups, add users to a group, and remove users from a group.
- Users with Edit Users, Groups, and AdministratorsEdit Users, Groups, and Administrators access can view all users, administrators,
and groups in the account and can add, edit, or close any user. They can perform bulk user
actions to add or update users, and can download users. They can also add, rename, and
delete groups, add users to a group, and remove users from a group.
Note: In an eSignature account linked to a CLM account where the delegated account
administrator is granted permission for Edit Users, Groups, and AdministratorsEdit Users, Groups, and Administrators, the
delegated account administrator can't edit users and groups through the Docusign
account administration user interface because the account is linked to CLM. Delegated
account administrators with this permission are able to edit users, user permission
profiles, and groups using the Docusign Admin API. They can also bulk add users through
the API. For more information about CLM administrators, see Types of Administrators in
Docusign CLM and CLM.CM.
Shared Access:Shared Access: When selected, users with this permission can set and modify user envelope sharing
settings. Because users with this permission can change information for other users, selecting
Shared AccessShared Access also automatically selects the Users and GroupsUsers and Groups setting with View OnlyView Only access.
Envelope Transfer:Envelope Transfer: When selected, users with this permission can transfer envelope and template
custody from one user on the account to another. Because users with this permission can change
information for other users, selecting Envelope TransferEnvelope Transfer also automatically selects the Users and Users and
GroupsGroups setting with View OnlyView Only access.
Document Retention:Document Retention: When selected, users with this permission can enable, disable, or modify the
document retention policy for the account. Users with this permission profile can also use the
targeted purge feature to add individual envelopes to the purge queue.
Account Settings:Account Settings: When selected, users with this permission can manage account settings, signing
and sending settings, and integrations (excluding Connect configuration). Users with this permission
profile cannot manage users, groups, or security settings.
Reporting:Reporting: When selected, users with this permission can access the reporting dashboard for
account-wide data. From there, they can run, customize, schedule, and download and print reports
for the account.
Security:Security: When selected, users with this permission can manage all items within the Security
Settings area. This includes items, such as account login requirements and password security
settings.
Signing Groups:Signing Groups: When selected, users with this permission can create, edit, and delete signing
groups.
Connect:Connect: When selected, users with this permission can manage all of the Connect configurations
and settings in the UI and in the API. Delegated administrators for Connect require the ability to send
envelopes in their permission profile so that they can send out the envelope event notification
Connect webhooks.
Stamps:Stamps: When selected, users with this permission can upload stamps and assign users to the
stamps.
Example: Select multiple permissions to tailor access

You can select multiple permissions to create any combination of access you want. For example, you might create a
permission profile that includes permissions for Shared AccessShared Access, Signing GroupsSigning Groups, and StampsStamps. Your delegated
administrator with this permission profile can add, change, or delete items in these areas.

In this example, when you select Shared AccessShared Access and StampsStamps, the Users and GroupsUsers and Groups setting changes to the
minimum access level of View OnlyView Only. If you want your delegated administrator to be able to edit groups, you can
select Edit Groups OnlyEdit Groups Only. Your delegated administrator with this permission profile can view users and can edit
groups. They cannot edit user information. Because you did not select Account SettingsAccount Settings or Security SettingsSecurity Settings, this
delegated administrator cannot view or change any settings in these areas.

Levels of access

Permission settings might not allow delegated users to access to all of the page settings within an administrative
area. For those page settings that delegated administrators can access, administrators can either view or edit page
settings. If the permission setting does not allow a delegated administrator to view or edit page settings, the page
settings are not visible in the administrative console.

Levels of access for administrative areas are designated as either EditEdit, ViewView, or NoneNone:

Edit
Users can view and make changes to page settings for an administrative area.

View
Users can view but not alter the page settings for an administrative area. Users may also be able to download

information that is visible to them.
None
Users do not have the ability to either view or edit settings for the administrative area.

Groups
Note: Docusign CLM enabled accounts create, edit, and delete groups for the account through Docusign
organization settings. Contact your Docusign administrator to manage groups at the organization level. For
more information, see Managing Groups.
As a Docusign account administrator, use the Groups page to manage the groups on your account.

Groups are used to organize users into functional units for template sharing to limit user access to templates.
Additionally, if multiple account brands are enabled, groups are used to set which brands can be used by group
members.

There are two default groups for every account: Everyone and Administrators. These groups cannot be edited or

deleted from the account. The Everyone group contains all active account users. The Administrators group has all
active users that have the All administration capabilitiesAll administration capabilities option enabled in their associated permission profile. If
your account includes the ability to define delegated administration permission profiles, users who are assigned to
these sets are not included in the Administrators group.

Add Groups
As an account administrator, you can organize users into groups.

Note: Accounts are limited to 1000 user groups.
From the Accounts view, select GroupsGroups.
Select Add GroupAdd Group.
Enter a name for the group.
Select AddAdd.
The group is created.
Select Assign UsersAssign Users.
Locate the account users that you want to add to the group by searching or viewing the list of all users.
Select the checkboxes next to the account users that you want to add to the SelectedSelected list.
Select AssignAssign.
The users are added to the new group.

Rename a Group
As an account administrator, you can edit the name of groups.

From the Accounts view, select GroupsGroups.
Find the group that you want to rename.
Note: You cannot edit the Everyone and Administrators groups.
Select ActionsActions > Rename GroupRename Group.
In Group Name, change the group name and select SaveSave.
Delete Groups
As an administrator, you can delete groups from accounts when the groups are not needed.

From the Accounts view, select GroupsGroups.
Find the group that you want to delete.
Note: You cannot delete the Everyone and Administrators groups.
Select ActionsActions > DeleteDelete.
Confirm that you want to delete the group from the account.
The group is removed from the group list.

Assign Brands to Groups
If your account includes multiple signing brands, you can use the groups functionality to manage which brands are
available to your Docusign account members.

For the custom groups you define for your account, you can assign brands to specify the ones that group members
can use. Group members can use the available brands when they send envelopes or create templates.

Note: You cannot assign brands to the two default groups: Administrators and Everyone. Account
administrators have access to all brands configured for the account, regardless of the groups they are assigned
to.
You can simplify and control brand usage in your account by limiting brand access by groups. In most cases, each
user likely needs to use only a single brand for their Docusign envelopes. But you may have defined multiple brands
to support various divisions or teams within your company. By assigning brands to groups, and assigning users to
those groups, you can control the brands used to send envelopes and create templates.

Example scenarios for users and groups

Here are the possible scenarios for users and groups, and how it affects the brands available:

User is not assigned to any groups. The user uses the default signing brand for all envelopes he sends
and any templates he creates.
User is assigned to a group that does not have any assigned brands. The user uses the default signing
brand for all envelopes he sends and any templates he creates.
User is assigned to multiple groups, which all have assigned brands. The user has access to all of the
brands assigned to all of the groups to which he belongs. He can select which brand to use for each
envelope he sends or template he creates.
User is an administrator on the account. Account administrators have access to all brands configured for
the account, regardless of the groups they are assigned to.
Assign Brands to Groups
As an account administrator, you can assign brands to groups for group members to use.

From the Accounts view, select GroupsGroups.
Locate the group that you want to assign a brand to by searching or scanning the list, and select it.
Select the BrandsBrands tab.
Select Assign BrandAssign Brand.
The brands configured for your account are listed.
Select the checkbox next to the brands that you want to assign to the group, and select AssignAssign.
All group members can now use the assigned brands on the envelopes they send and templates they create.

Change Brands Assigned to Groups
As an account administrator, you can add and remove brands from groups.

From the Accounts view, select GroupsGroups.
Locate the group that you want to assign a brand to by searching or scanning the list, and select it.
Select the BrandsBrands tab to open the list of assigned brands.
To remove brands already assigned, select RemoveRemove.
To assign additional brands to the group, select Assign BrandsAssign Brands, select the brands to assign, and select
AssignAssign.
Electronic Seal Administration
Electronic seals allow signers to digitally seal documents with their signatures. Electronic seals are applied on
behalf of legal persons. The legal person seal is applied on behalf of an individual who is sealing organizational
documents with an individual seal as part of their individual role within the organization. For example, a VP of Sales
applies an individual seal representing them as an individual to the official organizational documents. Users can
add electronic seals to documents if this feature is enabled in the account and they have the required permissions.
Read more about using Electronic Seals.

The administrator can delegate the use of an electronic seal to other users in the Docusign account. This includes
the ability to delegate basic seals to users who are authorized to use them on the basis of their relationship to the
organization, but also delegate legal person seals to people who are not associated with the seal. The administrator
can delegate a legal person seal associated with User A to be used by User B. The user associated with the seal (User
A) and the account administrator both receive a Docusign envelope that the administrator is authorized to delegate
the seal to another user or group in the Docusign account. If User A does not want the administrator to delegate
their legal person seal to User B, User A would need to contact the administrator to remove the permissions.

Administrators can use groups to manage who can use the seal. The administrator is responsible for creating a
group that includes the seal owner and any delegated users and linking this group to the seal. The administrator is
responsible for preventing unauthorized account members from using the seal.

A detailed audit trail is maintained for compliance purposes. The audit logs capture every action related to seal
delegation including the seal name, the group, the user making changes, and the event date.

For more information about managing groups, see the Groups topic.

Signing Groups Administration
Note: Signing Groups are incompatible with the Docusign mobile app. Users must sign in at http://www.docusign.com
to use the feature. If you do not see Signing Groups, the feature might not be enabled for your account. Contact
Docusign Support to enable this feature.
The Signing Groups option allows account administrators to create and edit Signing Groups. A Signing Group is
used to send documents to a group of people, where any member of that group can open and act on the document
fields addressed to the group, even though signature and other fields are not specifically assigned to a person.

Signing Groups Overview
When the signing group option is used, group members that open and sign the documents are tracked in the history
and certificate of completion. The members of a signing group are not required to have a Docusign account.

Once a signing group is set up, it is available for use by any account sender when adding recipients to an envelope.
The group can be added in the same manner as any other recipient. See this Signing Groups topic for more
information about sending envelopes with a Signing Group.

Adding an alternate email for notifications

You can choose to add an alternate email address for the signing group and have all email notifications sent to that
email address, rather than directly to the group members. When you use an alternate group email, only the
recipients who are also members of the signing group can view and act on envelopes sent to the group email. In

addition, with an alternate email, members must have a Docusign account to view and act on the envelope. If
members access the documents from the group email notification, they must first sign in to their Docusign account.

Add Signing Groups
As an administrator, you can create signing groups and optionally set up alternate email addresses.

From the Accounts view, select Signing GroupsSigning Groups.
Select Add Signing GroupAdd Signing Group.
Tip: You can use the CopyCopy option in the Actions dropdown to create a copy of an existing group and
then modify the members as needed using the following steps.
Enter a name for the new signing group. The name must be unique for all signing groups in the account.
Select SaveSave.
Locate the signing group that you created by searching or viewing the list.
Select ActionsActions > Assign UsersAssign Users.
Locate the account users that you want to add by searching or viewing the list of all users.
Select the checkboxes next to the account users that you want to add to the Selected list.
You can add up to 200 users in a signing group.
To add a signing group member who is not part of your account:
a. Select Add User ManuallyAdd User Manually.
b. Complete the Name and Email fields.
c. Select AddAdd to add the member to the group's Selected list.
(Optional) To have all email notifications sent to a single email address, select the Use an alternate email Use an alternate email
address for notifications sent to this signing groupaddress for notifications sent to this signing group option and enter the email address in the Email
Address field. The signing group members will not receive notifications at their respective email
addresses, but they can access the envelope from within their Docusign account. Or, if they have access to
the group email, they can use the link in the group email notification.
Select AssignAssign.
The assigned users are saved as members of the signing group. The signing group is available to all members of the
account.

Edit or View Signing Groups
Changes to a signing group do not affect envelopes that have already been sent and are still in progress, only future
envelopes sent using the group. In-progress envelopes are accessible to all group members included at the time of

sending. You can edit a group to change the name or modify the list of group members.

If you remove a group member , the sender must void any in progress envelopes for the group in order to
remove access to the member.
If you add a group member, the sender must resend any in progress envelopes for the group in order to
grant access to the new member.
If group members have changed their email address, you'll need to edit the signing group to remove the old
instance and then add in the new one.

From the Accounts view, select Signing GroupsSigning Groups.
You can view the list of signing groups, the number of users in each signing group, and the signing group
ID. The signing group ID is a unique identifier for the group. This identifier is useful for API developers
using the Docusign API.
Locate the signing group that you want to edit or view by searching or viewing the list.
Select ACTIONSACTIONS > EditEdit.
When editing a signing group, you can:
Change the signing group name.
Assign users to the signing group.
Remove users from the signing group.
Select SaveSave to save your changes.
Delete Signing Groups
Deleting a signing group prevents it from being used in the future. It does not affect any in progress envelopes sent
to the group. In progress envelopes will still be accessible to group members even if the group is deleted. To remove
access to these members, void the envelope.

If a signing group was used in a template, it is replaced with an empty recipient.

From the Accounts view, select Signing GroupsSigning Groups.
Locate the signing group that you want to delete by searching or viewing the list.
Select ActionsActions > DeleteDelete.
Confirm that you want to delete the group from the account.
The group is removed from the Signing Groups list.
Email Preferences
These settings are the default email notification preferences for all new users added to your account. Users can
change these settings in their preferences, as described in the Notification Preferences guide. Changes to these

defaults do not affect existing users.

The API User settings apply to envelopes sent using an API integration.

Set Default Email Notification Preferences for New Users

Signing and Sending
In the Signing and Sending section of your Docusign account settings, you can manage the default behavior and
various options for all documents sent from your account.

Signing Settings
These settings are the default signing behavior for envelopes sent from your account. In most cases, you can choose
to enforce these settings for all envelopes or allow account senders to modify the values for each envelope they
send.

You must be an account administrator with All Administration Capabilities in order to manage these settings. See
Permission Profiles for details.

Note: The information in these topics covers all signing settings available in Docusign. Some advanced features
and options are supported only in certain Docusign plans. Your account plan might not support some options
discussed in these topics. For more information about which options are available for your account, check your
account plan or contact Docusign Support.
Define Signing Settings
As an administrator, you can define the signing behavior for an account.

From the Accounts view, select Signing SettingsSigning Settings.

Signing Experience Settings
These settings determine how the signing experience is shown to signers:

In-session Landing Pages:In-session Landing Pages: Determine the web pages to which PowerForm (in-session) signers are routed
for a variety of situations. These users will be sent to the specified destination URLs for each situation. If no
URL is specified, users will be sent to a Docusign default destination URL.
Watermark Configuration:Watermark Configuration: The Watermark feature is designed to ensure that in-process transactions cannot
be printed and signed on paper and that any saved or printed in-process documents display a watermark.
When the Watermark feature is enabled and document signing is not complete, a watermark is displayed
on each page of the documents when a printable version of the document is downloaded. If the document
contains digital signatures, those signatures are stripped out.
When all recipients have signed the document, the watermark is removed from the printable version of
the document and digital signatures are visible.
Important: If the Watermark feature is active and the Allow recipient to sign on paper option is
enabled, the watermark does not display when viewing or downloading documents to sign.
Auto-Navigation:Auto-Navigation: This selects the document navigation option signing recipients see for their initial review
of documents during a signing session. The selected option controls the navigation behavior as the
recipient steps through the fields.
If you use Radio Buttons on your documents, the options to navigate blank required fields are
recommended for a smoother signing experience.
The available auto-navigation options are as follows:
Page Only:Page Only: With this option, there is no automatic navigation to the next field. The signer must
manually navigate through the documents. The signer can scroll through pages, select Next, or use
the document map on the right side of the browser to go to specific pages.

- Add Docusign frameAdd Docusign frame: A frame with extra information is placed around the signer’s signatures and
initials to make it easy to recognize the signature was created by Docusign. This extra information
appears on the documents, including the Certificate of Completion, sent from the account.
Note: The frame is not applied if the signer is using the Docusign mobile app to sign.
Do not add frameDo not add frame: Only the signer’s script name or initials are shown.
Sample signature and initials with the frame Sample signature and initials without the frame
With the Docusign frame selected, the signature is easily recognized as a Docusign signature.
If you expect to send documents to others who understand that the Docusign signature indicates a secure
document handling process, and that they can rely on the document to be tamper proof, that there is an
online backup, then you should enable the Docusign frame to indicate to others that the signature is from
Docusign.
If you expect to send documents to others who are not familiar with Docusign, and do not expect extra
layers of security, but perhaps just require faxed in documents, you can use the Do not add frame option
so that these recipients are not confused by the additional information.
Supplemental Documents
If supplemental documents are enabled for your account, you can specify the default recipient actions that signers
must complete in order to finish signing. Selection here makes an action required for all supplemental documents
sent from the account.

The settings you choose here are applied to all permission profiles on your account. With the Permission Profiles,
you can control users' access to the supplemental documents feature and whether they can override the default
actions when sending supplements. See the Send Supplemental Documents guide for more information.

The options are as follows:

Signers must view supplemental documents : Recipients must select the ViewView button on the supplement
strip to open the supplement view, which lets them read through the document, and download or print it.
Signers must accept supplemental documents : Recipients must select the AcceptAccept button on the
supplement strip.
Signers must read supplemental documents : Recipients must scroll to the bottom of the supplement.
This option is only available if both must view and must accept options are selected.
Supplemental document interactions are logged in both the History and Certificate of Completion for an envelope.

Envelope Delivery
These settings are used to set the envelope delivery options for recipients.

Attach documents to completion emailAttach documents to completion email: When selected all the completed documents are included in the
completed email sent to senders and signers as PDF file attachments. To include the Certificate of
Completion along with the documents, you must also select the setting Attach certificate of completion Attach certificate of completion
to envelopeto envelope.
Note: If sending or requesting sensitive information such as PII data during the signing process, we
recommend that you opt to not attach signed documents to the completion emails that get sent out to
all recipients. We recommend that you consult with your legal and privacy team to determine the
appropriate level of security for the account.
Attach certificate of completion to envelopeAttach certificate of completion to envelope: When selected, when an envelope is downloaded as a
Combined PDF, the Certificate of Completion is included at the end of the file. (The Certificate is always
included with the Separate PDF download option.) If the setting Attach documents to completion emailAttach documents to completion email is
also selected, the Certificate is included as a separate attachment to the completed email that is sent to
senders and signers.
Suppress emails to embedded signersSuppress emails to embedded signers: When selected, an email completion notice is not sent to
embedded signers when envelope signing is completed. This option is only used with the embedded
signing function and cannot be selected if the Send completion emails to embedded signersSend completion emails to embedded signers option is
selected.

signed documents (documents sent using the Sign a Document option) are presented to the email
recipients. This setting also affects self-signed documents sent from Docusign mobile applications. There
are two possible selections:
- LinkLink: A secure link to the self-signed documents is included in the email. Email recipients select the
link to navigate to the completed documents, where they can view and download the documents.
- PDFPDF: A PDF of the completed documents is attached to the email. Email recipients can view and
download the attached documents.
Envelope Download
This setting is used with regional signature validators when you want to download envelopes without the Docusign
seal. This is because the Docusign seal does not meet local requirements or it is not a listed and approved
certificate.

Note: If you have questions about using this setting, contact Docusign Support.
For more information, see the Docusign Seal topic and the Regional Signature Validators and the Docusign Seal
topic.

Allow agreements to download without the Docusign seal: Disable the generation of the Docusign seal
that is attached to each agreement after download.
Important: Allowing agreements to download without the Docusign seal is under the responsibility of
the account administrator. When this option is enabled and the last signature in the envelope’s signing
order is a digital signature, Docusign eSignature does not apply the Docusign seal to the agreement.
However, if the last signature in the envelope does not rely on a digital certificate, Docusign eSignature
enforces the Docusign seal to the envelope upon download.
Docusign Seal
When a user downloads an agreement, eSignature adds a digital Docusign seal to ensure that the document hasn’t
changed after signing. Account administrators can turn off Docusign seal generation for agreements whose last
signature is digital. This final digital signature acts similarly to the Docusign seal. It ensures that the document is in
its final form and secure. It also guarantees that the signature is affixed and encrypted in the final form in which it
appears.

Important: Allowing agreements to download without the Docusign seal is under the responsibility of the
account administrator. When this option is enabled and the last signature in the envelope’s signing order is a
digital signature, Docusign eSignature does not apply the Docusign seal to the agreement. However, if the last
signature in the envelope does not rely on a digital certificate, Docusign eSignature enforces the Docusign seal
to the envelope upon download. For more information about disabling the Docusign seal, see the Envelope
Download topic.
If you have questions about the setting to remove the Docusign seal, contact Docusign Support.
Despite the intended security benefits of Docusign seals, there are scenarios where they can cause confusion. For
example, local regulations and policies can require digital certificates to meet specific standards. Submitting
agreements with Docusign seals to validators in these regions may result in document rejection. Local validators
reject the agreements because the Docusign seal does not meet local requirements or is not a listed and approved
certificate. Local validators in these regions can validate those documents only if they contain a digital signature or
digital seal rather than electronic signatures.

Important: You and your users should be aware that by removing the Docusign seal, the signed document will
not contain the Envelope ID associated to the Docusign seal signature.
Regional Signature Validators and the Docusign Seal
What is the Docusign seal?

Docusign places a tamper-evident digital seal on all envelopes signed on the Docusign Signature Service.

The Docusign seal is placed on all envelopes when they are downloaded by any sender or signer.

The Docusign seal helps to ensure that envelopes are not altered after they have been signed. Docusign has

developed a feature that allows customers to disable the Docusign seal for envelopes that are signed using an
Advanced, Qualified, or any other x509 certificate.

Why might it be a challenge for regional validators?

In some regions around the world, local regulations and policies require the digital certificate to meet their country-
specific standards. In some instances, the Docusign seal does not meet these requirements or is not a listed and
approved certificate type. As a result, customers in these regions who use local validators will not have their
documents approved while the Docusign seal is affixed to their documents. For documents in these regions to be
validated by the local validators, they must contain a digital signature or digital seal rather than just electronic
signatures.

How does it work?

The option to enable the removal of the Docusign seal is under the responsibility of the account administrator.

After enabling the option, Docusign will not apply the Docusign seal as long as the last signature in the envelope’s
signing order is a digital signature.

Important: You and your users should be aware that by removing the Docusign seal, the signed document will
not contain the Envelope ID associated to the Docusign seal signature.
Why must the last signature be a digital signature?

Docusign is always looking to create a safe and secure signature process while enabling our customers to conduct
business in the global marketplace. Having the last signature in a signature flow be a digital signature ensures that
the document is in its final form, is secure, and the signature is affixed and encrypted in the final form in which it
appears. This permits the digital signature to act similarly to the Docusign seal to assure the customer that the
document is tamper-proofed in its final format.

What if my last signature is not digital?

In that case, Docusign will enforce its Docusign seal to the envelope upon download.

Signature Adoption Configuration
The Signature Adoption Configuration view is used to set the signing options for the account. From this view,
account administrators can specify which signing modes are available, limit signature styles for adopting a
signature, lock recipient name for signing, and set the minimum pixels required to adopt a drawn signature.

Note: Your account may be configured to provide only a subset of the three possible signing methods (select
style, draw, or upload image). In that case, only the methods supported by your account can be configured in
the signature adoption configuration view.
Configure Signature Adoption Options
As an administrator, you can configure the format for signature adoption.

From the Accounts view, select Signing SettingsSigning Settings.
In the Signature section, select the Signature Adoption ConfigurationSignature Adoption Configuration link.
Set the signature adoptions options described in the following topics.
Select SaveSave to save your changes.
Signing Options Limits
The three possible methods that recipients can use to sign are select a pre-defined style, draw a signature, or
upload an image file of their signature. To limit recipients' signing options, you can choose to disable all but one of
the three options (draw, upload, or select a style).

The Lock Recipient NameLock Recipient Name option prevents recipients from changing their name when adopting a signature. The
spelling used by the sender for the recipient's name is how they must sign the document.

Default Mode for Signature Adoption
This option sets which of the available signing modes is shown first when a signer is adopting their signature or
initials. If you prefer an option, but have not ruled out the others, you can set the preferred option to display when
the Adopt Your Signature dialog box displays. Recipients can still select any of the other signing modes configured
for the account.

Start on adoptStart on adopt shows the Select Style mode, with the different signature styles.
Start on drawStart on draw shows the Draw mode, where the signer draws their signature or initials.
Start on uploadStart on upload shows the upload mode, where the signer can upload an existing file with their signature
or initials.
Separate settings are available for Docusign web app and mobile web signers.

Minimum Pixel Size
To ensure that drawn signatures and initials are visible on completed documents, set a reasonable minimum pixel
size. This minimum is applied to drawn signatures only, and does not apply to uploaded images.

Signature Styles
Select the signature styles available for signers to choose from in the Adopt Your Signature dialog box. If no styles
are selected, Arial Unicode is used. The Arial Unicode signature style cannot be removed from the list.

For language-specific styles, select the language tab and select the signature styles. The language-specific styles are
presented to a signer who is signing in that language.

Signature Pads
The Docusign Signature Pad option extends signing functionality to signature pads for Docusign customers. The
Docusign Signature Pad option supports Topaz Systems, Inc™ and ePadLink™ ePad- ink™ signature pad devices.

Additional requirements

of electronic documents. This setting is only visible if it is enabled for your account plan. For more
information about this setting, see PDF/A Conversion and Compliance.
Docusign FeedbackDocusign Feedback: If selected, senders on the account will receive occasional surveys within the
Docusign application to collect their feedback on the sending experience.
PDF/A Conversion and Compliance
PDF/A is an ISO-standardized version of PDF for archiving documents. PDF/A requirements do not allow the
documents to include JavaScript, audio, video, and external fonts. Encryption is also not allowed. Under the ISO-
standard, the PDF/A documents are converted into an ISO-standard format intended for long-term preservation of
the document’s content.

Administrators can control the conversion of documents to the PDF/A format at the account level. Administrators
can turn on the Enable PDF/A Conversion and ComplianceEnable PDF/A Conversion and Compliance setting on the Sending Settings page in the account
administration settings. When this setting is enabled by the account administrator, all new envelope documents
uploaded in the account go through PDF/A conversion and compliance checking against the PDF/A ISO-standard.
The documents are available in PDF/A format when downloaded.

PDF/A conversion includes a validation and repair process. Under this process, the PDF document is inspected to
check if it meets the requirements of PDF/A. If it does not, it is often possible to repair the document to meet the
requirements. For example, if a PDF document has references to external fonts, the PDF document can be repaired
by embedding the font.

PDF/A “compliance” means that the document is saved in a format that meets the PDF/A ISO-standard. Specifically,
a PDF/A-conforming document contains metadata that identifies the PDF/A level and the subvariant, such as PDF/
A-1a or PDF/A-2u. PDF documents extracted from a downloaded envelope archive (.zip file) are PDF/A compliant.

Important: Docusign disclaims any express or implied warranties that a converted PDF/A document meets a
customer's specific needs.
Only the documents uploaded in the envelopes after the PDF/A setting is enabled go through PDF/A conversion and
compliance. If the setting is turned off, the documents uploaded in the envelopes do not go through PDF/A
conversion and compliance.

For more information about PDF/A standards, see PDF/A in a Nutshell.

Limitations and other considerations

Downloading combined documents is not recommended. Instead, to preserve the PDF/A conversion of
individual documents in the envelope, you can download an envelope archive (.zip file) or a Portfolio PDF.
The envelope archive (.zip file) keeps the individual documents intact, whereas a combined document
download loses document metadata. Currently, using a Portfolio PDF is available only through the API.
The Portfolio PDF is a container file that contains any embedded files, which are kept intact and can be
extracted.
Supported conformance levels include:
PDF/A-1b, PDF/A-1a
PDF/A-2b, PDF/A-2a, PDF/A-2u.
PDF/A-3b, PDF/A-3a, PDF/A-3u, PDF/A-4e, and PDF/A-4f are not currently supported.
Documents saved as PDF/A might contain additional metadata and become larger in file size since external
objects are embedded in the PDF. The appearance of the document is not affected.
During Document Upload, there might be a minor increase in the latency due to additional operations for
conversion and repairs for PDF/A.
Recipient Roles
These settings enable additional recipient actions that senders can select when adding recipients.

additional option Present this information request to in person signersPresent this information request to in person signers is available. If selected, this option
requires the in person signing host to collect the requested information from the signer before the signer
can begin signing. A free text field is provided to enter the information request to be shown to in person
signers.
All in person signers are shown the same request and must provide a response. The response is saved and
included on the Certificate of Completion in the In Person Signer Events section.
See In Person Signing for more information about using this feature.

Email Archive Configuration
This feature allows an account administrator to set up email addresses that automatically receive copies of
Docusign signature requests and other email notifications for a sender’s account archiving and regulatory
compliance purposes. When the option is enabled and at least one email address is active, a copy of each Docusign
system-generated email sent to a sender or recipient for the account is also sent to the active email archive
addresses. See the Email Archive Configuration View topic for more information on “active” email addresses.

Important: Email addresses where non-archival, general business activity may occur are not suitable and
should not be used for email archiving with this feature. Customers are strongly advised to implement special
archival email addresses with heightened access controls due to the increased sensitivity associated with
notifications delivered to the archival email address using this feature.

The Email Archive Configuration view shows a list of active, pending, and closed email archive addresses associated
with the account. This view allows you to add, close, and view the history of the email archive addresses. An
account can have up to five active or pending email archive addresses.

When an email address is added to the list, Docusign sends a validation email to that email address. The validation
email contains a link that, when selected, activates the email address. If the link is not selected, the email address
remains in a pending status and email copies are not sent to the email address.

To ensure that Docusign emails are not going to junk or spam folders for the active email addresses, you can allow
email from dse@docusign.net and the domains @docusign.net and @docusign.com. Optionally, you can allow
emails for specific IP addresses. For more information about the current Docusign IP address ranges, see Security
for Docusign eSignature in the Docusign Trust Center.

As an account administrator, you can add addresses to the email archive.

Remember: An account can only have a maximum of five active or pending email archive addresses at one
time.

Custody Transfer Rules
Docusign account administrators can add and manage rules to automatically transfer ownership of envelopes
between users in the same Docusign account from the Custody Transfer page.

Note: The Transfer Custody feature must be enabled for your account to be able to transfer ownership.
To transfer envelopes or templates manually, see Transfer Envelopes and Templates.

Envelope Custody Transfer Rules
Custody transfer rules are set up to transfer envelope ownership from an individual user, or a group of users, to
another user automatically when envelopes are sent or completed. When ownership is transferred, the envelopes
are removed from the original owner’s account and added to the new owner's Manage page. The original owner will

only retain access to the envelopes if the transfer rule adds them as a carbon copy recipient.

The Custody Transfer page provides a summary view of all envelope custody transfer rules for your account. The
summary view shows who, a user or group, envelopes are transferred from, who they are transferred to, the
destination folder for the transfer, when the transfer happens, and if the transfer rule is enabled.

Custody transfer rules cannot be modified. After rules are added, they can only be disabled, enabled, or removed.

Note: To learn more about envelope custody transfer, see the Best Practices for Envelope Custody Transfer
guide.
Add Envelope Custody Transfer Rules
Custody transfer rules can be set up to transfer envelopes from an individual user or group of users when the
envelope status changes to Sent or Completed. Envelopes can only be transferred to users in the same account.

Note: You must be a Docusign account administrator with All Administration Capabilities to add custody
transfer rules.
From the Accounts view, select Custody TransferCustody Transfer.
Select Add RuleAdd Rule.
The Add Custody Transfer Rule page displays.
In the From section:
a. Select if the transfer is from a single user (From UserFrom User) or from all the users in a group (From GroupFrom Group).
b. Select the user or group that documents are transferred from. Multiple users or groups can be
selected, but users and groups cannot be selected in the same rule.
In the To section:
a. Select the user that the envelopes will be transferred to.
b. Select the destination folder for the envelopes in the Folders list.
In the Transfer Time section:
a. (Optional) You can clear the Add Original Owner as Carbon CopyAdd Original Owner as Carbon Copy setting to remove the original
sender entirely from the envelope transaction. This option is selected by default and adds the
original sender as a “Receives a copy” recipient for the envelopes they send. If you clear the setting,
the original sender cannot access the envelopes or view the documents and will not receive
notifications.
b. Specify when the envelopes will be transferred: On SendOn Send or On CompleteOn Complete.
c. (Optional) For On Send transfer rules, you can select the Transfer prior to first sendTransfer prior to first send option. When
selected, ownership is transferred before the envelopes are sent and the new owner becomes the
sender in all emails to recipients. The original creator will be added as a “Receives a copy” recipient
only, provided the Add Original Owner as Carbon CopyAdd Original Owner as Carbon Copy option is selected.
Important: For On Send transfer rules, if the Transfer prior to first sendTransfer prior to first send option is not selected
and all recipients are in the same routing order, the recipients receive the email invitation from
the original sender. Subsequent email messages are from the user to which the envelope is
transferred.
If the Transfer prior to first sendTransfer prior to first send option is not selected and there are recipients in multiple
routing orders, the recipients in the first routing order receive the email invitation from the
original sender, while subsequent recipients in the routing order receive the email invitation
from the user to which the documents are transferred.
Select SaveSave. The rule is saved, enabled, and added to the Custody Transfer rule list on the Custody transfer
page.
Note: If the transfer From or To user is closed or the destination Folder is deleted, the transfer rule is

Document Retention
With a document retention policy, you can set the number of days to retain completed, declined, and voided
documents. Setting a document retention period is optional. By default, Docusign securely retains all customer
documents on the service for as long as the account is active.

When an account is closed, Docusign purges all sent, signed, and voided envelopes that are older than two years
from the account closure date. User information is also purged from the account. If the account is subject to any
legal obligation to comply with applicable law regarding retention, that obligation supersedes our retention policy.

If you choose to set a retention period, any affected envelopes are placed in a purge queue prior to actual purging.
After expiration of the purge queue period, the Docusign system deletes the documents in the envelopes.

The maximum retention period that you can set is 9,999 days.

Note: Users can read Purge Envelopes for information on purging.
Note: For more information, read the Best Practices for Docusign Document Retention and Purging whitepaper.
Set Document Retention Periods
As an administrator you can modify the document retention policy. For example, you can specify the number of
days that documents are retained. You can also specify how personally identifiable information is treated when
documents are purged.

From the Accounts view, select Document RetentionDocument Retention.
Select Enable document retention policyEnable document retention policy.
In the Keep for this many daysKeep for this many days field, enter the number of days you want to keep documents before
sending them to the purge queue. For all envelopes sent from your account, the documents from each
completed, voided, or declined envelope will be moved at the end of the retention period to a purge
queue (14 days under normal queue processing conditions), and then permanently removed from the
system. The time is measured from the date that the envelope is completed, voided, or declined and is
completed during overnight processing.
Values: 1-9999
Note: When you activate or change a retention policy, affected envelopes are added to the purge
queue within 24 hours, under normal queue processing conditions. The policy is applied to all
completed, voided, or declined envelopes in your account.
(Optional) If necessary, select Remove fields and metadataRemove fields and metadata and Redact personally identifiable informationRedact personally identifiable information.
When Remove fields and metadata is selected, Docusign deletes the envelope documents as well
as any fields that were added to the documents and any API attachments that were added to the
envelope from the system.
When Redact personally identifiable information is selected, Docusign redacts all personally
identifiable information from the envelope, certificate of completion, and history. Fields that store
personal data, such as name, physical address, email, and IP address, are replaced with the text
“Redacted”. Time stamps for when actions took place are left intact, but you won’t be able to
identify the person who took that action.
Note: The process of redacting personal data cannot be undone. Each individual’s personal
information on an envelope will be redacted from the envelope, rendering the audit log and
certificate of completion untraceable.
If these options are not selected, when envelopes are purged, Docusign deletes only the envelope
documents from the system.
Select SaveSave.
Document retention is set to remove your completed, voided, or declined documents from the Docusign
system after the specified retention period and subsequent purge queue period.
Note: To disable the policy, clear the Enable document retention policyEnable document retention policy checkbox and select SaveSave.
Disabling an existing policy will remove any envelopes currently in the purge queue.
Set Draft Envelope Retention Periods
You can modify the draft envelope retention policy to specify the number of days that draft envelopes are retained.
After the number of days has passed, the drafts are deleted from the system without further notification.

From the Accounts view, select Document RetentionDocument Retention.
Select the Envelope Retention PolicyEnvelope Retention Policy tab.
Select Set the draft envelope retention policy for this accountSet the draft envelope retention policy for this account.
In the Keep for this many daysKeep for this many days field, enter the number of days between 30 and 120 to keep draft envelopes
before sending them to the purge queue. The default value is 30 days.
Select SaveSave.
Purge Queue and Notifications
If you have set a document retention period, when that number of retention days is reached, the envelopes are
placed in a purge queue. Under normal queue processing conditions, the queue lasts 14 days after which the
documents within the envelopes are permanently deleted.

If the remove metadata option is selected in your document retention settings, then all field data and any
API attachments are also deleted.
If the redact personally identifiable information option is selected, Docusign redacts all personally
identifiable information from the envelope, certificate of completion, and history.
Notifications

As a default configuration in the Sender’s account, when an envelope enters the purge queue, two separate email
notifications are sent as follows to the sender and any recipients associated with the documents who have a
Docusign account:

When the envelope first enters the purge queue (in 14 days prior to purge, under normal purge queue
processing conditions), a warning email notification is sent informing that the documents will be deleted.
The email provides a link to the documents, providing an opportunity to view, print, and download the
documents before they are deleted.
A second email notification is additionally sent, generally 7 days later, prior to expiration of the purge
queue period as another reminder of the upcoming purge.
Note: If any party on a Docusign transaction deletes an envelope before it is purged, they will still receive the
purge warning notifications. The only way for a sender or recipient to not receive these notifications is to
disable the notification option in their My PreferencesMy Preferences > NotificationsNotifications.
Changing retention period

If your account is using document retention and you decide to change the retention period, all account envelopes,
including those in the purge queue, are affected as follows:

Disable document retention. Any envelopes in the purge queue, except those placed in the queue using
Targeted Purge, are removed and the documents will be retained.
Increasing the retention period. The increased retention period is applied to all envelopes, including
those in the purge queue. Any envelopes in the purge queue remain in the queue, but the purge queue
start date is delayed to reflect the new retention period.
Decreasing the retention period. The reduced retention period is applied to all envelopes. Any envelopes
that have met the new retention period are moved into the purge queue. Decreasing the retention period
does not affect the purge queue start date of items already in the queue.
Resources Related to Document Retention and Purging
The following resources provide account administrators with more information about document retention and
purging:

Document Retention and Purging Whitepaper
Document Retention and Targeted Envelope Purge: What you should know
Purging Envelopes
Purge Envelopes - Managing Envelopes for Senders
Purging Envelopes
Docusign account administrators can search for and purge all completed, declined, or voided envelopes on the
account that have been sent from or signed by a specific email address. Envelopes purged in this way are
immediately moved into the purge queue. For more information about the purge queue, see Document Retention.

Note: To be purged, envelopes must have a status of Completed, Declined, or Voided. In-process and Draft
envelopes cannot be purged.
Along with deleting the documents, you can also choose to delete the envelope's metadata and redact all
personally identifiable information from the envelope, certificate of completion, and history. The metadata
includes any fields that were added to the documents and any API attachments that were added to the envelope
from the system.

By default, Docusign securely retains all customer documents on the service for as long as the account is active.
When an account is closed, Docusign purges all sent, signed, and voided envelopes that are older than two years
from the account closure date. User information is also purged from the account. If the account is subject to any
legal obligation to comply with applicable law regarding retention, that obligation supersedes our retention policy.

Transfer of Envelopes and Templates Between Users
As an account administrator, you can manually transfer envelopes or templates between users. When you transfer
ownership of envelopes or templates, the transferred items are removed from the original owner’s account and
moved to the new owner's account.

Note: The Transfer Custody feature must be enabled for your account to be able to transfer ownership of
envelopes and templates.
Transfer of Envelopes and Templates to Account Users
Transferring envelopes and templates is useful when you close a user, or a user's role in your company changes and
you want to assign responsibility for their Docusign items to another account member.

You may have someone who creates all of your account templates. Once a template has been created, you may
want to transfer ownership to someone else on your account for ongoing maintenance. Anyone with whom a
template is shared can edit or delete it. Administrators can edit or delete all account templates, regardless of
ownership.

Administrators can transfer envelopes and templates between users from either the Users page or the Custody
Transfer page. They can also transfer items directly from within their Docusign account, using the Shared Envelopes
interface to transfer envelopes, and the Templates page to transfer or delete templates.

Note: For more information about deleting templates from within your Docusign account, see Delete
Templates.
Transfer Envelopes and Templates Between Users
As an account administrator, you can manually transfer envelope or templates from one user to another from either

Custody Transfer Rules for Envelopes
In addition to manual transfer of envelopes, you can establish custody transfer rules to automatically transfer
envelope ownership from an individual user, or a group of users, to another user when envelopes are sent or
completed. When ownership is transferred, the envelopes are removed from the original owner’s Sent list and
added to the list for the new owner. The original owner will only have access to the documents if the transfer rule
adds them as a carbon copy recipient.

For more information, see Custody Transfer Rules.

Transfer of Envelopes

Electronic Record and Signature Disclosure
If enabled for your account, the Electronic Record and Signature Disclosure (ERSD) is shown to each new recipient
who is going to sign or add other information, or is required to view the documents you send to them. Recipients
must read and agree to the terms of the disclosure before they can access and take action on the documents you
send. The ERSD does not apply to copy-only recipients but does apply to recipients who must sign or view your
documents.

Docusign provides a default ERSD disclosure for the convenience of U.S.-based customers only. This default
disclosure is only valid for transactions between U.S.-based parties. View the sample legal disclosure.

Customize the default ERSD or create your own

As an administrator, you can customize values in the default disclosure or create your own free-form disclosure
from the Legal Disclosure page. You can provide custom values to tailor the default disclosure for your company. Or
you can create a new disclosure with your own text and HTML formatting. Changes to the legal disclosure are
captured in the account audit log.

Docusign does not automatically translate your custom disclosure. You must create your own custom disclosure for
each language used by your signers.

If you have questions about using a disclosure, contact your legal counsel.

ELECTRONIC RECORD AND SIGNATURE DISCLOSURE

From time to time, [[CompanyName]] (we, us or Company) may be required by law to provide to you certain written
notices or disclosures. Described below are the terms and conditions for providing to you such notices and
disclosures electronically through the Docusign system. Please read the information below carefully and
thoroughly, and if you can access this information electronically to your satisfaction and agree to this Electronic
Record and Signature Disclosure (ERSD), please confirm your agreement by selecting the check-box next to ‘I agree
to use electronic records and signatures’ before clicking ‘CONTINUE’ within the Docusign system.

Getting paper copies

At any time, you may request from us a paper copy of any record provided or made available electronically to you
by us. You will have the ability to download and print documents we send to you through the Docusign system
during and immediately after the signing session and, if you elect to create a Docusign account, you may access the
documents for a limited period of time (usually 30 days) after such documents are first sent to you. After such time,
if you wish for us to send you paper copies of any such documents from our office to you, you will be charged a
$[[CopyCostPerPage]] per-page fee. You may request delivery of such paper copies from us by following the
procedure described below.

Withdrawing your consent

If you decide to receive notices and disclosures from us electronically, you may at any time change your mind and
tell us that thereafter you want to receive required notices and disclosures only in paper format. How you must
inform us of your decision to receive future notices and disclosure in paper format and withdraw your consent to
receive notices and disclosures electronically is described below.

Consequences of changing your mind

If you elect to receive required notices and disclosures only in paper format, it will slow the speed at which we can
complete certain steps in transactions with you and delivering services to you because we will need first to send the
required notices or disclosures to you in paper format, and then wait until we receive back from you your
acknowledgment of your receipt of such paper notices or disclosures. Further, you will no longer be able to use the
Docusign system to receive required notices and consents electronically from us or to sign electronically documents
from us.

All notices and disclosures will be sent to you electronically

you through the Docusign system all required notices, disclosures, authorizations, acknowledgements, and other
documents that are required to be provided or made available to you during the course of our relationship with
you. To reduce the chance of you inadvertently not receiving any notice or disclosure, we prefer to provide all of the
required notices and disclosures to you by the same method and to the same address that you have given us. Thus,
you can receive all the disclosures and notices electronically or in paper format through the paper mail delivery
system. If you do not agree with this process, please let us know as described below. Please also see the paragraph
immediately above that describes the consequences of your electing not to receive delivery of the notices and
disclosures electronically from us.

Reminders and Expirations - Account Defaults
These settings are the default behavior for all envelopes sent from your account. As an account administrator, you
can choose to enforce these settings for all envelopes, or allow users to modify the values for each envelope they
send.

Note: Users can always use the resend envelope feature to send a manual reminder to recipients whose turn it
is to sign.
You must be an account administrator with All Administration Capabilities to manage these settings. See Permission
Profiles for details.

For information on how senders can modify reminder and expiration settings on each envelope they send, see the
Set Advanced Options for Your Signers, Envelopes, and Templates topic.

Set Account Reminders and Expiration Defaults
As an account administrator, you can set reminders and expiration time frames for envelopes sent from an account.

From the Accounts view, select Reminders and ExpirationsReminders and Expirations.
To allow users to change the account defaults on the envelopes they send, select Allow senders to Allow senders to
override account defaultsoverride account defaults.
To enable and set automatic reminders:
a. Select Send automatic remindersSend automatic reminders.
b. Enter values for how many days to wait until sending the first reminder and how many days to wait
between subsequent reminders. Use integers from 1-999.
If you enter 0 for the number of days between reminders, no reminders will be sent after the first
one.
For envelope expiration, enter how many days after sending an envelope expires and how many days
before expiration to warn signers. Use integers from 1-999.
Reminders
(Default: Off; Values: 1-999 days)

You can turn on reminders to send follow-up emails to signers automatically. When you enable reminders, you
specify when and how often to send notifications. The number of days before sending the first reminder should be
less than the number of days before the request expires.

Envelope Expiration
(Default: 120 days; Values: 1-999 days; no warning)

By default, requests to sign or view expire 120 days after sending the envelope. You can modify this value as
needed. You can also add the option to send signers an expiration warning.

Docusign recommends that you enter a low value for the option Days to warn signers before expirationDays to warn signers before expiration, such as 3
days. Warning signers of an expiring envelope improves the outcome of getting envelopes to complete instead of
expiring.

When an envelope expires, the status changes to Voided and it can no longer be viewed or signed by recipients.

When an in-process envelope reaches six days to expiration, a warning icon displays and the status shows
"Expiring". Hover over the status to show the expiration date.

Document Custom Fields
Docusign users and administrators can create custom versions of standard fields and save them for reuse on future
documents. Define any combination of field properties, such as font type or size, or a validation setting. Document
custom fields help speed up document preparation by allowing you to save fields customized for repeated use.

The custom fields created by users display in the Fields palette for adding recipient fields to documents. Custom
fields are also listed in their user preferences.

Account administrators can view and manage the custom fields saved by all account users, as well as add new
custom fields for themselves or to share with all users.

Note: Changes to Document Custom Fields are captured in your account audit log.
Note: Some advanced features and options are supported only in certain Docusign plans. Your account plan
might not support some options discussed in this help topic. For more information about which options are
available for your account, check your account plan or contact Docusign Support.

Identity Verification Configurations
Administrators can create and manage identity verification configurations that senders use to verify the identity of

recipients. Administrators can specify the verification service provider, the countries and regions from which IDs are
accepted, and the signature type associated with each configuration. They can also determine which, if any, ID
evidence data is stored by Docusign.

Note: For more information for senders and recipients using ID verification, see ID Verification.
Add Identity Verification Configurations
Before you begin

Japanese customers, note that you can set up this configuration to store the back of IDs, including Japan's National
Identity Card (My Number Card). If you implement this setup, ID Evidence will store the 12-digit individual number,
which is personally identifiable information (PII). Instead, you may use the Docusign ID Verification with Japanese
IDs configuration. This ID Verification method respects data privacy by only allowing storage of the front of
Japanese Individual Number Cards.

As an account administrator, you can add a configuration to accounts to verify the identity of recipients. By default,
each account must have at least one configuration for identity verification. You can add configurations as needed.

From the Accounts view, select Identity VerificationIdentity Verification.

not stored. For more information about how and where data is stored, see the ID Evidence page.
Attention: If your configuration authorizes the use of Japanese Individual Number Cards and allows
storage of data on the back of IDs, ID Evidence will store the 12-digit individual number showing on the
back of Japanese Individual Number Cards. This data is personally identifiable information (PII) and
considered sensitive. To avoid this situation, either unselect storage of the back of IDs or remove the

Add Identity Verification Configurations for Japanese IDs
Before you begin

To add identity verification configuration for Japanese IDs, you must respect the following requirements:

Your account must subscribe to the ID Verification or ID Verification Premier packages.
Your account must be located in Japan, which means the account is provisioned in the JP1 data center.
As an administrator, you must add an ID Verification configuration that supports Japanese IDs to use as a part of
your overall effort to comply with KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-money Laundering) regulations.

Docusign ID Verification with Japanese IDsDocusign ID Verification with Japanese IDs is a configuration for Japanese users to verify their identity with local
KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) regulations in mind. It uses image-processing
technology and biometric authentication to verify the identity automatically. This way, Japanese users can quickly
identify as part of an eKYC-compliant digital contracting process.

Important: We recommend that you consult with your legal and compliance teams to assess what may be
required for eKYC compliance specific to your organization.

(Optional) Select the type of IDs you want to accept in the dropdown menu.
(Optional) Select the additional data that you want ID Evidence to store for each ID verification.
If you choose to store the selfie image in ID Evidence, the image remains available for only 90 days after
verification. After 90 days, ID Evidence removes the access to the selfie from the proof file. Senders can no
longer download the selfie.
Also, if you choose to save the front and back side images of ID documents, ID Evidence stores both images
except for Individual Number Card. In this case, ID Evidence only saves the front image for privacy reasons.
Note: ID Verification can only store the data you check if it is available in the ID document the signer
selected for verification. For example, if you check the box for Height data, but the ID does not include
Height, we cannot store it.

Identity Verification for FINTRAC Compliance
The Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) is the financial intelligence unit and
anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing supervisor in Canada.

FINTRAC regulations and compliance apply to organizations in Canada that are part of any type of financial

transaction. Examples include banks, credit unions, and insurance companies. For a complete list of institution
types, see the Who is this guidance for article on the FINTRAC website.

If you are performing identity verifications as one of the applicable institution types in Canada, you can use the
FINTRAC Compliance configuration to outline the FINTRAC requirements. The Docusign FINTRAC configuration
using Identify Liveness includes all of the mandatory fields required for ID Evidence to comply with FINTRAC
requirements. By using the FINTRAC configuration, your identity verifications should meet the FINTRAC compliance
requirements.

Your Responsibility for Retaining FINTRAC Information

FINTRAC requires that the financial institution or organization retains the information relating to the identity
verification checks for a minimum of five years. You are responsible for storing the information locally within your
company’s control. Docusign is not responsible for assuring you have complied with this retention requirement. You
can save the related data by downloading a PDF or using the API to collect the data and store it outside of Docusign
for the required time period. FINTRAC requires that you keep records so that they can be provided to FINTRAC
within 30 days of a request. For more information, see the What are my responsibilities when maintaining records?
article on the FINTRAC website.

Activate the Identity Verification for FINTRAC Compliance
To use the FINTRAC configuration in templates or envelopes, activate the Docusign ID Verification for FINTRAC
compliance configuration. The FINTRAC configuration is available in all eSignature accounts. To maintain
compliance, the Docusign ID Verification for FINTRAC compliance configuration cannot be copied or edited.

Signature Types
Electronic signatures are a common part of modern agreements. However, there are circumstances where digital
signatures are necessary for businesses, regions, or specific use cases. These provide extra assurance by using
digital certificates to verify identity.

Digital Signatures

A digital signature is an electronic signature with a digital certificate to authenticate the signer’s identity. Digital
certificates indicate that signers have completed extra steps to confirm their identity. Signers use digital certificates
to issue digital signatures on documents. A document’s digital signature proves the signer’s identity and the
document’s integrity.

Docusign eSignature provides its own set of digital signatures. It also partners with Trust Service Providers (TSP),
integrating their signatures into the eSignature workflow. TSPs integration allows you to meet local standards, no
matter where you are.

Signature Types

A signature type is a digital signature applying to a specific use case or country. For example, DS Email is a signature
type covering all the primary requirements for digital signatures. If you need enhanced verification of the signer’s
identity in the European Union, you can also choose the DS EU Advanced signature type.

When senders create envelopes for signature, they select a signature type for each recipient. The signature types
available to a sender depend on the account configuration. Account administrators can use the Signature Types
page to choose the signature types available for an account.

Table 1. signature type properties

Property Description
Name Name of the signature type as it shows to senders in the
Signature Type list when creating an envelope.
Jurisdiction Area or legal authority that enforces the rules for using a
signature type. Jurisdiction decides which laws apply to
digital signatures. Therefore, it ensures that signatures
are valid and accepted in a particular area or country.
Level Degree of assurance that a digital signature is a reliable
indicator of the signer's identity and the integrity of the
signed document. For example, countries in the
European Union support the following levels of
signatures: simple, advanced and qualified. Other
countries may support similar levels with distinct

names.
Device Appliance containing the digital certificates that
eSignature uses to generate signatures. Signers usually
store their certificates on the cloud or using a physical
device like a smart card or a USB key.
See the eSignature Legality Guide page for more information on the supported jurisdictions and levels of signature.

Signature Type Management

The Signature TypesSignature Types page lists all the signature types available to senders when they create envelopes. The first
signature type in the list applies by default on envelopes unless the sender selects a distinct signature type. From
this page, administrators can add, remove or change the position of signature types in the list.

Apps and Keys
The Apps and Keys page provides API information for your account, the integration keys associated with your
account, and a way to add integration keys.

An integration key (also known as an API key) is a unique GUID used to identify your API integration. An integration
key is required to authenticate your API calls with Docusign. Your account can have as many test integration keys as
you'd like. You can also have multiple keys in production.

Note: The full functionality of this view is only available in the Demo environment. After a key has been moved
to the Production environment, the account it is linked to is used to manage secret keys, RSA keypairs, and
redirect URIs.
For more information about using your integration key with the Docusign API, visit the Docusign Developer Center.

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for Applications
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header-based mechanism that allows web browsers to request
resources from other origins. Enabling CORS allows applications running in a browser to directly access the
Docusign eSignature REST API without requiring a backend server.

As a developer, you can configure your application to use CORS. In the Apps and Keys page, you can specify allowed
origin URLs from which your app can make CORS requests. In the CORS page, administrators can enable or disable
CORS permissions for individual applications. Administrators can also set CORS to be enabled or disabled by default
for all new applications.

For information on using CORS, see the following topics in the Developer Center:

information such as historical API usage, successful and failed API calls, the distribution of API calls across all
accounts API connections, and the API limits.

See API Activity by App for more information about viewing API activity.

API Efficiency

The API Efficiency section inside the API Usage Center contains components that assess your app’s efficiency and
offer recommendations for how to improve it.

See Efficiency score factors for a complete list of factors included in the analysis.

API Limit Management

Each account has an hourly API call limit, which is the maximum number of calls permitted from all apps associated
with the account. If the account exceeds the limit, calls will be blocked until the start of the next hour. If you already

optimized efficiency and your account continues to exceed the limit, you can increase it in the API Usage Center.
The limit management feature enables account administrators to change the hourly limit without contacting
support.

Information displayed

The information displayed in the audit logs includes the following:

Event Date: The date and time the account change was made. The date and time shown uses the time
zone setting for your browser and will vary depending on your browser settings.
User: The name and email address of the user who changed the setting. Usually, this is an administrator.
This column shows the user as "Docusign System" to indicate a change made to your account by a
Docusign technical process. This occurs when a new user activates their account, or if there is a change in
your account plan where features are added or changed. This column shows the user as "Docusign System
User" to indicate a change made by an internal Docusign employee if you requested a change to your
account. Contact Docusign Support if you have any questions about a change completed by one of these
users.
Description: The category for the changed setting. For categories that have multiple entries, such as
Users, the name of the entry is also included in the description.
Example: If you change something for user John Jones, the description will show "User Setting Change -
John Jones".
Field: The name of the field that was changed.
Old Value and New Value: The old and new values for the field.
In some cases, the Old Value field might be blank. This is expected and only means that there was no old
value for the field.
For fields that use a check box, a value of True means that the check box is selected. False means that the
check box is not selected.

Automate Common Post-Signature Tasks With Agreement Actions
Note: Agreement Actions is not included with all account plans. If you do not see Agreement Actions, it may not
be enabled for your account. Contact Docusign Support for assistance.
With Agreement Actions, account administrators can automate common post-signature tasks when an envelope is
completed. You can create agreement rules based on document custom fields, template type, or envelope data.

The rules can trigger actions, such as archiving to a cloud storage application, starting a Docusign CLM workflow,
and exporting data to a spreadsheet.

Note: For more information about CLM workflows, see Agreement Actions in CLM.
Connect an Application
As an administrator, you can connect applications to Docusign for use with Agreement Rules.

From the Accounts view, select ConnectionsConnections in the AGREEMENT ACTIONS section.
Select CONNECT NEW APPCONNECT NEW APP.
Select the application that you want to connect to Docusign.
Enter a nickname for your account and select SAVESAVE.
Note: Consider using a service account and not a personal account to log into your application. A
service account allows multiple administrators to manage service account credentials.
Log in to the application that you are connecting, and select Grant AccessGrant Access.
The application is added to your Active AppsActive Apps list.
Note: Docusign does not store credential information. This process uses standard Open Authentication
(OAuth). Docusign only seeks permissions to create files and folders when processing a rule.
The application you selected is displayed in the Active AppsActive Apps list.

Manage Connected Applications for Agreement Actions
Before automating post-signature tasks in an external application, you must connect your application to Docusign.

Currently, the following applications are supported:

Box
Docusign CLM.DS and Docusign CLM.CM (formerly SpringCM)
Docusign eSignature
Dropbox
Google Drive
Microsoft OneDrive
Microsoft SharePoint Online

Note: When you remove an app, the authentication token is removed. All access privileges are
revoked for the app.
The app you selected is either updated, disabled, or removed from the list of connected apps.

Create and Manage Agreement Rules
Agreement rules determine actions for completed envelopes. Rules consist of two main components:

Conditions : Determine when an agreement rule should be executed
Actions : Determine what should happen in connected applications
Rules follow a pattern of 'If condition then action .' Rules can range from simple to complex, and you can include
one or more conditions or actions in a single rule.

You might start a workflow by creating a rule like the following example:

If a completed envelope is sent from either the U.S. Order Form or from the U.K. Order Form templates, then start
the New Order workflow in Docusign CLM and export the envelope data to a Google Sheet.

Note: Rules and actions cannot be migrated across eSignature accounts.
Create an Agreement Rule
You can automate actions taken on completed envelopes by creating rules. To create a rule, set the conditions for
your rule and the actions that are taken when the conditions are met.

From the Accounts view, select ConnectionsConnections in the AGREEMENT ACTIONS section.
Select ADD RULEADD RULE.
Enter a name for your rule.
Note: The Enable ruleEnable rule option is selected by default. A selected rule becomes active after you save it.
You can disable the rule to prevent it from applying to actions.
Select the scope of the conditions that affect the rule.
Condition types:
- All: All conditions are true for the created rule.
- Any: Any aspect of the conditions is true for the created rule.
Choose your first If condition to decide who or what the rule applies to.
Document Custom Field: The rule applies when a value is entered or selected in a specific
document custom field. Select the document custom field from the list and enter the value you'd
like to check for.
Envelope Custom Field: The rule applies when a value is entered or selected in a specific envelope
custom field. Select the envelope custom field from the list and enter the value you'd like to check
for.
Recipient: The rule applies to the selected recipient. You can enter either a full or partial email
address, for example, both joe.sample@docusign.com or @docusign.com.
Sender: The rule applies to the selected sender. Select the name of the sender.
Template: The rule applies to the intended template, which you choose by selecting the type or
name.
Note: Document custom fields and envelope custom fields display a list of all eligible fields on the
account. The account must have fields available to use these conditions.
Select the filter criteria for the conditions.
Is: The rule applies only when the value is present.
Is not: The rule applies only when the value is not present.
Contains: The rule applies only when the value is present in some form.
If you need another condition, select Add Another Condition.
Note: You can add up to 10 conditions to an agreement rule.
Select one of the following actions:
Archive to:Archive to: Archive completed documents to a cloud storage provider.
Start Workflow:Start Workflow: Begin a workflow in Docusign CLM.DS or Docusign CLM.CM (formerly SpringCM).
Export to Spreadsheet:Export to Spreadsheet: Export the envelope data to a spreadsheet.
(Optional) Add another action.
Note: You can add up to three actions per rule.
Review the rule, and select SAVESAVE.
The rule is saved.

Archive To Action
Completed documents are saved to the selected cloud storage provider, such as a shared drive in Google Drive. You
can determine how documents are archived.

Customize envelope settings: Select Include Certificate of CompletionInclude Certificate of Completion to save the certificate in the same
folder as the signed document. For more information about the Certificate of Completion, see History and
Certificate of Completion.
Select Combine all envelope contents into a single ZIP fileCombine all envelope contents into a single ZIP file if you want to archive all documents in an
envelope as a single .zip file.
Customize file name and folder name/path : Customize the file name and location. Type the + sign and
select one of the envelope fields to use a dynamic value to name your documents, for example the name
of the template used or the recipient names.
Note: You can also enter the name of the destination folder at the beginning of the file name to save
the documents in a specific folder. For example, Offer Letters/FY21/ saves the documents in the FY21
subfolder in the Offer Letters folder.
Note: When archiving to Box, the file paths are case-sensitive. If you receive an error that an item with
the same name already exists, then the folder might already exist with a different capitalization.
Correct the capitalization or choose a different location.
Note: If you add an envelope custom field to a file and folder path in an agreement rule, and any input
to the field is not found when the rule runs, this field displays as "-" in the file and folder path. To
continue using this rule, complete the value for the field or delete the envelope custom field from the
file and folder path.
Export to Spreadsheet Action
You can select a spreadsheet that is stored in a connected application to export and store data from completed
envelopes.

Agreement Actions supports several cloud storage providers: Google Drive, Microsoft SharePoint Online, and
Microsoft OneDrive for Business.

The first time you export to a spreadsheet, the columns headers are determined by the first envelope that is

evaluated by the associated rule. The sheet will use these headers for future exports. For best results, create
separate sheets for each template to ensure that all data is captured.

The following data is exported to the spreadsheet:

Standard envelope information, including the envelope subject, ID, and the sender name and email
address
The document name and ID
Recipient name and email address
Value entered in the document fields by the different recipients
Template details, including the template name
Value entered in the envelope custom fields by the senders and template creators
Note: The data is exported to a Raw DataRaw Data tab in the spreadsheet. A best practice is to leave this tab untouched
and rename and filter the data columns and values in a separate tab.
Start Workflow Action
eSignature accounts that are linked to a Docusign CLM.DS or Docusign CLM.CM account can kick off a workflow
when envelopes are complete.

Note: If you do not have access to a Docusign CLM.DS or Docusign CLM.CM account, contact Docusign Support
for more information.
Docusign CLM Workflow is a powerful tool to help your business automate processes that require repetitive human
action. You can include tasks in your CLM workflows, such as generating a document, sending a document for
signature or for review, creating a folder structure, and much more.

For more information about creating and managing workflows, see the following references:

Agreement Rules Modification
Administrators can edit existing rules from the RULESRULES page of the Agreement RulesAgreement Rules area. From the ActionsActions menu,
administrators can modify the conditions and actions associated with the rule, disable the rule, or delete the rule.
Disabled and deleted rules no longer affect completed envelopes.

Agreement Rules Logs
The Agreement Rules LOGS page tracks the actions that are triggered by the rules. The logs contain information
about the conditions set for the rules and actions that were taken.

A log is created each time an agreement rule results in an action whether it is successful or not. If an envelope
triggers multiple rules, there is a log for each action that results from the evaluation of those rules. Similarly, if a
rule has multiple actions, there will be multiple log entries.

You can view details about a rule, such as the envelope ID and request ID, from the View detailsView details option in the
ActionsActions menu. These details help support teams troubleshoot issues with actions.
